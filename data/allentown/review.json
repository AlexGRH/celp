It just screams cheap. Not to mention it kills quite a few options for the gluten free crowd. Shame. The decor was nice,  nicer than I'd expect from a place in a strip mall.  And the wait staff was friendly. Also didn't care for them talking me out of ordering rolls with brown rice. Prefer to eat healthier whenever possible. If your sushi chefs aren't skilled enough to roll with it,  don't offer it on the menu. \n\nAlso,  if I mention I have a wheat allergy,  and I order quite a few things that have wheat to whatever degree in it  alert me before you make my order,  not after and point out I can't eat 90% of what you bring out. I purposely ordered a couple things so my date could enjoy more,  but things I've been ordering for years many other places without issue contained wheat (crunch most likely) here. Again  just seems like they're trying to go on the cheap.", "date": "2013-03-21 14:49:28"}

So i figured I would give this place a try and it did nothing for me.\nI ordered the Thai Iced tea (which was weirdly served with whipped cream) and was WAY too sweet. When I asked the server if it could be fixed, she just told me to add water to it. Moving past that, I ordered the veg Tempura but the tempura batter was plain and not flavorful at all. The soy sauce served for dipping at the time added no flavor to it. I ordered the Spicy Thai Basil vegetables and asked if I could add tofu to it. I was told there was tofu in it already. When I received it, there was no tofu in it and the  dish was not spicy and also lacked flavor. It wasn't bland per say but it just felt like a meal that wasn't worth going out to a restaurant for. So overall, I wasn't impressed. Maybe I was just unlucky and ordered the few things on their menu that weren't good. On the other hand, the decor is really nice which was a nice surprise. The ambiance is impressive and the presentation of their food is quite impressive as well.", "date": "2013-07-20 18:45:37"}

Even my taste-restrictive parents love this place.  I think they have a very unique sauce for the General Tso's dish.  Their sauce is very sick, but not overly sweet like some places.  They also have a wider variety menu than most places (Chinese, Japanese, and Thai options).  The closest thing I have to a criticism is that the Thai dishes were OK, not great like the rest of their dishes...but that is stretching for a criticism.

They have a fantastic and varied menu; the best of all (Asian) worlds!

This place serves up the best Shumai I've ever had. The Sushi is fantastic, I've had Sashimi, and the fish is very fresh. I haven't tried the Hibachi, so can't comment on that. The Thai curry is better than that of the totally overpriced White Orchids. The ambience is nice, but it gets really loud in there due to the Hibachi and the accompanying shrieks from people who act like they're seeing the Onion volcano for the first time. Servers are very friendly. They do have an alcohol license if you're looking for a Sake fix.

The only reason is the unlimited all you can eat made to order sushi for twenty dollars. You're warned only order one to two rolls at a time.

They have great sushi though and the unlimited sushi is great because you can order any of the rolls/ special rolls.

It's the calming with the lighting, and just trendy enough to set it apart (without being overdone) from other Asian restaurants in the area.\n\nThe food is good, although I think some of the sushi rolls are a bit overpriced and my Bento Box came out a little cold at lunch; however, it was really busy so I'm not overly concerned about it- the flavors were spot on! My friend got General Tso's, and that was delicious too. Lunch portions are perfect, being big enough to be filling but small enough so you aren't lagging the rest of the day. The food is surprisingly light for this type of cuisine.\n\nService here is wonderful. The staff is incredibly friendly and attentive. I think this would be a really fun restaurant to go to with a small group of people.\n\nMy only note would be that some of the sushi comes with a soy wrap instead of seaweed. I have an allergy to soy, and I didn't read the menu closely enough so I was a bit surprised when my Peking Duck roll came with a soy wrap- no harm done though.
