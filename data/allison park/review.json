BYOB is always a plus. My favorite roll is the Sunkist Roll. Get this one! It is a spicy salmon topped with very thinly sliced lemon slivers. It definitely has a kick to it, but the balance of lemon adds freshness. SO GOOD. I have never had a problem with the freshness or taste of any items on the menu. \n\nSince they are under new management, they have a new menu, but still have some of their signature rolls from the previous menu. The veggie roll has definitely improved on the new menu! \n\nOne thing that makes me sad is that it is always super slow when i go... I think they get a lot of take-out orders, but it is also in a hidden spot so many people probably just don't know about it. I could see that being a turn-off when someone walks in and it's empty. I took my aunt there, and she was very skeptical that it wouldn't be good, fresh, etc. She had reservations of the quality of the place, but after we ate she took them back.

When I told the waiter he said he would bring out another roll with just opened fish but that was just as bad.  I would have preferred them to have just replaced it with another roll or credited us.    Even after telling him the new roll was bad they still charged us for the roll.  I also ordered the BR7...BAD IDEA.  This is allegedly Ben Roethlisberger's favorite roll (it's a crab nigiri roll).  Honestly I had one bite and couldn't eat any more of it.  Also, the sushi rice was exceptionally cold and hard.  The house salad was the poorest excuse I've seen for a salad...there was only iceberg lettuce (usually sushi restaurant house salads have some carrots and radishes in them) and it was lettuce from the very interior of the head, very white and even more tasteless than normal.  The dressing also had no \"meat\" to it like the normal ginger dressings from sushi restaurants.

I gauge how good a Thai restaurant is based on their curry and Tom Kha soup... here's my review:\n\nBoth takeouts were Green Curry (one Veggie and one Tofu) cause that's my favorite dish and tells me whether this restaurant is any good or not... I basically put myself in a food coma both times because it was amazing and I couldn't stop eating it!  Portions were perfect.  Word to the wise... Curry is already spicy so don't overdo it with a higher spice level.  I ordered a 1 out of 0-4 and it was plenty hot for me.  I was definitely feeling it \n\nToday, arrived at 11:30 am with no wait, picked our table and were well taken care of by the waitstaff.  Ordered Tom Kha soup (spice 2) and Thai Basil with Tofu (spice 1).  Tom Kha was on point... it was definitely fresh with a stronger lemongrass flavor which made it more bright. I also enjoy Nicky's Thai Tom Kha because I literally feel like it's giving me a warm hug from the inside.  This one would boost my spirit with it's brightness!  I LOVED it!  Thai Basil with Tofu was amazing as well... I was stuffed when I left and am positive I will return.

This bakery is one of the spots I found and bookmarked.  A few days ago, it happened to be open so we popped in.  We were greeted and offered complimentary ladylocks.  She also showed us around and pointed out their various specialties.  I'd hoped for buying a single cookie or two, which is possible with the elaborately decorated cut-out cookies, but the buckeyes and Pittsburgh specialties are sold by the dozen.  I'm glad we were pointed to the refrigerated case where there are sampler packs.  I thought about the peanut butter sampler (4 buckeyes, 4 peanut butter blossons, and 4 peanut butter cookies baked around peanut butter cups) because I am a peanut butter fiends, but I decided instead to get the sampler pack with 12 different cookies.  Most of the dozens, whether singular or sampler, were about $10.  I thought it would be fun to share all these classic Pittsburgh cookie-table cookies with my husband, and justified this purchase by planning to do a weird thing my family does: cut everything in even fractions.  I expected my mom to be offended that I bought all the cookies she knows how to bake at a bakery (I planned to use the come back \"but you don't anymore\") but both she and my dad were pleasantly surprised when I appeared on their doorstep.  It's been several days now and the 4 of us have been doing an incredibly disciplined job of nursing this sampler pack to its max. My husband had never had a buckeye before (dear ol' mom \"ran out of time\" and did not make them for the cookie table for our wedding!) but had only had most of the other varieties that one time at our wedding.  Still, two years out, it was fun to have again: kolaci, nut balls, pecan tassies, peanut butter blossoms, and buckeyes.  There was some sort of caramel-nut shortbread, a citrus-iced cut-out cookie, an excellent coconut macaroon, a miniature cheesecake, a chocolate cupcake, and maybe something else.  While no one cookie was knock-my-socks-off amazing, it was a really fun experience that lasted for days!  I agree with others that the baked goods here are a classic Pittsburgh experience.  If I lived here, I would consider getting the sampler for out-of-town visitors.  It mimics so many fond memories without the insanity of baking all twelve varieties yourself!\n\nEdit: I originally posted this as a 4 star review.  I upgraded it to the full FIVE after I had the last two cookies (ssh don't tell the fam).  I was having trouble sleeping and they called to me from the refrigerator.  I am picky about cake, but the miniature chocolate cupcake was so fudgy it knocked my socks off.  In went all four little quarters of it.  Next went the peanut butter cookie with the peanut butter cup, which was good.  But it was the cupcake that was the surprise hit.", "date": "2017-07-21 17:30:56"}

They tried out levels 2 and 3 in different dishes and found that 3 was very spicy but 2 was just right.\n\nWe also ordered the Tom Kha soup ($4.95).  Now, let me tell you, my family and I have developed an obsession for Tom Kha soup.  We've been on the hunt for a delicious bowl of the stuff close to home, and this hit the spot!  The coconut broth was AMAZING - very flavorful!  I had mine with tofu, which was very soft and well-prepared.  Be sure to try a bowl of this soup when you visit!  You won't regret it!\n\nFor the entrees, I had the Pad Thai with chicken ($12.95).  It came out very hot and was well-presented on the plate.  The noodles and chicken were cooked well and the peanut sauce was super yummy!  This dish was definitely the favorite for my family!  Another member of my family ordered the Green Curry with chicken ($12.95) and thought it was very tasty; the sauce was full of flavor and the veggies were fresh and abundant.\n\nKanlaya Thai Kitchen is a great addition to the community!  The food was all very fresh, high quality, and well-presented.  The level of service easily matched the quality of the food.  If you're in the area and looking for something new to try for lunch or dinner, be sure to check this place out!", "date": "2017-10-14 16:04:59"}

I went to this studio because of the good reviews and was disappointed. I was looking for a dress that had not too much poof and was simple. No sparkle, no bling. \n\nI was worried from the start as I looked through the dresses and didn't really see anything that I thought looked like my style. I kept moving forward, however, thinking you don't really know what a dress looks like in the bag on a hanger. The attendant kept pulling dresses for me that were so completely not what I wanted it started to become almost comical. I appreciate the thought that a bride should try on a dress just in case it looks amazing but these dresses that were pulled were literally some of the most atrocious dresses I've seen. It became very clear very quickly that the attendant was not listening to anything I was saying. There was a dress I pulled that was simple and strapless- everything that I was looking for. I didn't even get to try on this dress because the attendant kept insisting the dress wouldn't fit. This may have been true but I was unclear why the attendant couldn't see that that was the style dress I was desperate to try on and didn't try and find another dress that would fit and matched that style. She was so desperate for me to try on dresses she was pulling dresses that were 5 sizes too big for me so I could see the style and insisted I could just have the dress taken in. \n\nNot every shop is going to have the style dress I am looking for and that is fine. I would have been completely happy to try on dresses at This Magic Moment, realize there was nothing I liked and carried on with my day. In fact as I was getting ready to leave, I was perfectly happy. I saw what I needed to see, tried on some dresses and decided there wasn't anything there for me. We thanked the attendant for taking the time to assist us. Probably embarrassed that they didn't have anything I liked, the attendant tried to turn things on me and claimed my budget was too low and that's why I wasn't able to find a dress. Interesting how that's possible when we had told the attendant there wasn't a budget...Again showing how little the attendant listened during our visit.  \n\nOverall, I did enjoy that the store is open only for you so you're not comparing yourself to other brides and there's less pressure. They supply you with a nice welcome sign and some wine and water so you can really make yourself at home. I can believe that other brides have been quite happy here but you have to have a very specific style in mind for your wedding.", "date": "2017-11-21 18:59:12"}

I truly appreciate and also embrace the concept of full body healing, which is what their services are based upon.  After several months of regular appointments and adding just a few recommended supplements, I am truly able to see and feel a huge improvement in so many areas - not just chiropractic.  I love the fact that visits are kept to a shorter amount of time, but are efficient and still very personal and flexible - allowing enough time to converse about any new areas of concern, questions or comments and still encompass a full treatment, sometimes from head to toe.  The scheduling is excellent - I have rarely had to wait more than a few moments for my appointment - as Kristen and Dr. Josh are very conscientious about being timely.  I find this particularly appealing as my chiropractor on the West Coast - as much as I loved his treatments - was chronically late, sometimes up to an hour wait for an appointment.  While this may be a turn off for some patients, as it doesn't allow quite as much flexibiity for unforeseen circumstances, as a very busy business owner, I certainly appreciate the fact that I can absolutely count on being seen on time and I know exactly how much time I will be away from the office.  And as a tradeoff, I am fully aware that I may have to forfeit a visit if I am unable to be on time, which I gladly accept. I look forward to continued improvements in my overall health and well being and also look forward to being able to take advantage of many of the other additional services Dr. Josh and Dr. Vanessa offer in the very near future.

It was a gel manicure. I loved it and is held together well except for normal growth. I couldn't get to a salon until three weeks after the wedding and my nails were a mess. \n\nI tried to find a salon between work and home and stumbled on this one. I asked when I arrived for a gel manicure and how long it would be before I could be seen. Receptionist was friendly, went and checked - five minutes - which was fine with me. \n\nThere were a number of woman there in various stages of manicures and pedicures. The place seemed clean, well lighted and had a friendly atmosphere. \n\nTwo young girls who came in after me were taken before me, but the manager explained that I would only wait another second or two - which was accurate.\n\nSo far, I had no problem overcoming my language barrier in communicating with staff.\n\nWhen I sat down with my nail tech, the negative part of my experience began. She tried to remove the polish, which did not come off. She called over the manager, although I could not translate what she said, I surmised this from the actions that occurred. I did sense some frustration on the part of the nail tech. At the end of the conversation, both the nail tech and the manager walked away. When the nail tech came back, she said, as best as I could understand, that if I came in with nails like I had again, I would pay $44 and I would have to pay $44 again. Those were the last words that she said to me in English.\n\nShe removed the old nails, worked to apply new nails, offered no instruction as to my role in this process except to look at me when I did not move my hands to the proper location in the process and then move them for me. During all the work she did, which was very efficient and looks fine in finished project, she carried on conversations in her native language with other techs in the store. I could not tell if they were laughing at my situation or something else.\n\nThe techs in DC also spoke English as a second language..but they engaged me in conversation and spoke to each other in English in front of customers. The salon was a bit larger (more chairs) and had many more customres. And, the service was exactly the same price. \n\nTechnically, Image Nails is a good salon. Personal and professional service is limited. I plan to go back for fill in after two weeks to test the process again, but I am still looking for an alternative.", "date": "2011-06-16 17:35:42"}

Excellent Thai food, just a notch below Nicky's (and to be honest, hard to decide if the ambiance at Nicky's has something to do with it).  Had the Tom Yum soup, which had excellent depth of flavor.  Same with the Basil Chicken.  My wife had the Pineapple Rice, which was great - loaded with pineapple, raisins, and veggies. Shared Crispy Spring Rolls, which came out piping hot and were loaded with chicken and veggies.\n\nAll the veggies were cooked spot on.  And there were a ton of fresh veggies in every dish.  \n\nI love spicy food, went with a 4 on both the soup and Basil Chicken.  Perfect spice level for me.  The couple next to us went with a 1, and commented that they should have chosen a 0.\n\nSaw that they had Mango with Sticky Rice on the desert menu, although seasonal.  Didn't think they would have it, but the waitress said they did.  Five minutes later, she told us that the chef could not prepare the dish, as the mango was not ripe enough, and comped us a desert (Fried Banana, which was also excellent).  We were not upset at all, and were happy to know that the chef would rather not make the dish than send out below-par food. Excellent sign of a restaurant that cares about its food and guests.\n\nOnly knock I have is that they seemed to be short-staffed.  The poor servers were literally running between tables and handling the take-out orders.  There were 10 take-out orders during our meal, so they need to hire a dedicated staff member to work the front counter and handle take-out.  That said, even though short staffed, our server was attentive and we didn't feel like we were forgotten.\n\nDon't let the outside of the place fool you.

DO NOT USE THIS BAKERY. I'm sure most times, the bakery is fine.  At this point, I couldn't even tell you if their stuff tastes good because I didn't even get that far.  If there is anything wrong with your order, expect to be treated poorly.  The customer is not always right at this establishment.  The owner is always right and doesn't make mistakes.  My experience was that when my brother showed up to pick up my 3 dozen custom cupcake order, they didn't even have it.  I had 35 people coming to my house in 3 hours for my daughter's fourth birthday party and they didn't have my order.  It was a high school aged girl working - the owner was off that Saturday.  She called the owner who said that I gave her the wrong date and there was nothing that could be done.  End. Of. Story.  Even I could whip up 3 dozen cupcakes in three hours if I had nothing else to do.  No accommodations at all.  The best part - she called the following week to see if I still wanted my order for the following Saturday.  This is when it got even worse.  I wanted to give her calm, constructive criticism regarding my disappointing experience.  She kept speaking over me and told me that I had given her the wrong date because how could she have written down a date that I didn't say?  There has never been a mix up like this and it had to be my fault.  She also told me that the \"young kid\" that picked up the order (my 30 year old brother) didn't seem to care at all that they didn't have them and so they figured the following Saturday would work for us.  DOES THIS EVEN MAKE ANY SENSE?  I am not one to write reviews unless something is so off the charts wrong (or fabulous).  For the most part, I think businesses should be able to do their jobs.  This has me completely flabbergasted and so appalled that I want to share with everyone. \n So, what happened with my daughter's fourth birthday?  We called the Oakmont Bakery (which we always use, but decided to give Perfect Pastry a try since the Hulton Bridge was out).  They were able to accommodate my exact custom order except for the fondant decoration.  The owner of Perfect Pastry was happy that I found someone but informed me that it was because Oakmont Bakery freezes their stuff ahead of time and that is why the Perfect Pastry bakery is a quality bakery.  What is simply amazing is that the Oakmont bakery had the exact flavors and glittered frosting colors ...wow, good job Oakmont!

I took my disabled mother to get her nails done at this salon. I had my 3 year-old daughter in tow. While we waited for my mother, I had my daughter's nails painted. She finished earlier than my mother, and while we were waiting for mom to finish up, my daughter announced that she had to go \"potty.\" Because there were two customers in our party, I figured that there wouldn't be an issue. I asked the owner if my daughter could use the restroom, and she told me that there was someone locked in there and that I should walk my child across the plaza to Panera. Mind you, she is a 3 year-old and Panera was a 5 minute walk from us. I explained that it wasn't an option for me to do this. I sat back down in the waiting area with my daughter,  praying that she didn't have an accident. 10 minutes later, an employee of the salon exited the restroom. I was flabbergasted. I want sure how a business  couldn't provide a restroom to a paying customer. I guess the situation could have been made better of the owner attempted to see how long it would take for us to access the bsthroom. At that point, it was time to leave, and I helped my mother (who is on a walker) up to the register to pay. I guess the owner thought that we were trying to skip out on the check and began screaming that we didn't pay her. She did this in front of other customers. The pinnacle of this extremely unpleasant experience was when she reprimanded my mother for calling her too frequently to set up an appointment. My mom can no longer drive, and called twice that afternoon. The first call was to see available appointments, (she then called me to confirm that I could take her,) and then called the salon again to make the appointment. The one positive was the the young nail tech that painted my daughter's nails was very sweet. However, due to the lack of professionalism and customer service I would strongly advise against patronizing this business.", "date": "2018-07-04 00:46:20"}

My husband had undercooked scallops surrounded by mashed potatoes!  A friend of mine visited for lunch and was also disappointed.  After driving by Spadafora's for the last several weeks, we all noticed more cars in the parking lot and a sign that proclaimed \"best Italian Restaurant from Pittsburgh Magazine\"  My friends and I decided to give it another chance.  We have a girls night out for dinner once a month and like to visit local eateries rather than the chain restaurants.  There were 4 of us and were seated at a table that could seat four if the chairs were placed on all 4 sides of the table.  However, the ownership placed two chairs side by side, leaving the other sides  of the tables open. If we would have tried to eat, we would have been bumping each other.   We asked the waitress if we could move the chairs around and she said go right ahead and make yourself comfortable which we did.  While we were eating, a gentleman came over to us (we think it was the owner)  and asked if we could move our table around so he could seat a party of three at a table beside ours  that could barely seat two at best.  He wanted to put the third chair right beside our table.The chairs actually would have been back-to-back.    We tried moving the table around but now we were blocking the diners to our right.  He gave up and the folks had to wait until a table opened up.  (Not an unusual occurrence in a busy restaurant).\n\nWe were all OK with the fact that the restaurant is tightly packed with barely enough room to move between the tables.  We were comfortable where we were.  But we were really annoyed that our comfort and the comfort of the folks dining to our right was going to be compromised by the owner trying to shoehorn three people in a space that was barely suitable for two.  We all wanted to love this restaurant and put it on a \"must do again\" list - we all live rather close and it's nice to frequent a neighborhood restaurant, but felt the owner was more interested in jamming another paying customer in rather than risk them walking out the door due to their inability to immediately get a table.  Our comfort did not matter at this time, since we were already eating our dinner and payment was assured.  \n\nIf you go, plan on being very close to your fellow diners and you may be asked to share your table with strangers!!\n\nThe food was OK.  I had the gnocchi with the pink sauce.  The sauce was good, the gnocchi was heavy.  My friends liked their dinners - veal parm, lasagna and Mediterranean pasta.  House salads were ho-hum.

However our excitement turned to disappointment with our first and only visit.  Perhaps it was because first impressions are lasting ones or perhaps because we lived in Thailand and know what authentic Thai food shood taste like. Out of the box, the only silverware given is one fork...not a knife and a fork or a spoon and a fork but one fork.  This in itself wouldn't be so bad but the fork was not even clean--DIRTY..not just water stains that could be rubbed off but crusted food on a fork. \nWe asked for \"prik nam plaa\" (spicy fish sauce) and were told the restaurant doesn't use fish sauce because of all its vegetarian customers..We then asked for the typical sauce caddy that are ubiquitous in Thai restaurants..no joy on that either. This was the first and only Thai restaurant that we have ever visited that did not provide the prik nam plaa or a sauce caddy with hot sauce, sweet sauce etc.\nWe ordered several plates varying from two to three stars hot out of four stars...I guess we should have ordered five star hot because with the exception of the papaya salad the food was bland.\nWe absolutely love Thai food but won't be visiting Kanlaya again.\nThe only thing that saved this from being a one star was the service which was polite and attentive.", "date": "2018-10-10 13:41:18"}

The gentleman I worked with on the tires was very pleasant and I asked about getting my car inspected that was due in March.  He stated that I could have my car inspected that day because it was no more than 15 months from the current stickers.... Great! I could have all the work done in a one stop shop. \nMy car was inspected and passed, when I returned to pick it up, I was informed I was charged $150 for an alignment and roadside hazard.  I had not requested these services and assumed that this was an error.  The gentleman (who was awesome (drives a Tahoe) was apologetic and removed those services.  \nWhen I got home I realized a January sticker had been placed on my vehicle.  I called the shop on Monday and spoke to Scott and he stated that I should have gotten a March sticker.  He said that I would need to return when the technician who inspected my sticker was available which was Tuesday 7:30-4.  As a single mom with a full-time job, this was not an easy feat - I had to rearrange my work schedule to allow for the late arrival.  I sat in the parking lot until 7:50 on Tuesday and no one arrived to open the shop.  \n\nI called corporate and was promised a call back from Dan the District Manager.  That call never came.  Hoping it was a weather issue; I called the Allison Park Location again and was told to bring my car in this morning.  \nI came in this morning (another hour personal time at work) and Scott and the Inspection Tech were in the lobby.  Scott informed his employee that he was to put a March Sticker on my car, at which point the Tech refused stating that inspection law requires the registration and the sticker match.  Scott and I tried to explain to the tech that the rules state 15 months from the time of the last sticker.  The tech (very condescendingly) stated he has been doing this for 45 years and he knows he is right.  I became escalated and left, as this issue cannot cost any more.  \nPlease be advised under the PA Guidelines for State Inspections Sub Chapter C \"Procedure\", Section 175.41: \n(1) An annually inspected vehicle will receive an inspection for 1 year from the expiration of the safety inspection sticker which is about to expire, except motorcycles, which receive an expiration in accordance with charts provided by the Department. A sticker may not be issued for more than 15 months from the month of inspection. If a vehicle, other than a motorcycle, does not display a currently valid certificate of inspection, the vehicle shall receive an inspection valid for 1 year from the month of inspection.", "date": "2015-01-29 21:12:16"}

I went there to have my dogs ears cleaned and plucked. The woman took my dog in the back and without even using powder to ease the hair out of the dogs hair (less pain more comfort) she plucked the hair out. My dog was crying and her ear was bleeding. The woman did not seem to care and the following day my dog got her first ear infection. I'm the type of person that avoids confrontation but if I could do it over again I would've lost my mind while I was there. I was shocked how lacking of empathy they where. The dog day care area was dirty upon a further look and way too small. Not a good feel from the people there. Let's just say I hope I never see that woman again. Makes me sick.

I have bought all of my riding gear here. The staff is always very knowledgeable and helpful. About a month ago while just browsing the showroom I asked if they repaired ripped jackets. The riding jacket I bought there about a year ago had a Velcro tab on the sleeve that the seam was ripping off. They informed me that if I bought it there that it was guaranteed for 5 years. I told them I didn't have the receipt, but they said they would have it on record. They said that they would just swap it out with a new one for no charge. So then I asked if I could upgrade to a jacket with a liner and just pay the difference. They said \"no problem\". Then I found the jacket that I wanted but they didn't have it in the color that I wanted. They ordered in in for me, and I picked the jacket up two weeks later. They didn't even charge me the additional charge. They said that being it took so long not to worry about the extra cost. This is the best service I have had form any retail store ever!!! If you ride you need to visit this place. They have something there for every kind of rider. I have a BMW K1200LT and the prices at the BMW dealer are down right scary. Cycle Gear has riding gear to suit everybody budget. Check out there web site and sign up for there mailing list to get all of the latest sales.

Just because you have several Pittsburgh sports memorabilia on the wall, although some of it was neat and had a historical flare to it, doesn't make you a sports bar.  As far as the food, forget about it...terrible.  Menu was lacking in substance and was quite generic and bland in its description of the establishment's offerings.  My wife ordered a grilled salmon salad which was just okay (was all iceberg lettuce which is a travesty with any salad).  My son had the children's spaghetti and meatballs...sauce tasted old and straight out of a can or jar and the meatballs were over seasoned with garlic.  I had the All You Can Eat Fish which I must say was the most terrible fried fish I've had in the Pittsburgh area, but possibly anywhere.  I asked what kind of fish it was and it was something I had never heard of before.  It was overcooked and dry, with little to no flavor.  The french fries were undercooked and soggy, and my side of broccoli was overcooked and tasted unlike any broccoli I've had before.  Definitely don't eat here if you're looking for a decent tasting meal, let alone fresh.  When I told our server (who I think was the owner as well) about my fish dinner that I couldn't eat, she did apologize and took it off the bill, but said to me that she couldn't believe it was as terrible as I said because \"no one's ever said anything bad about our fish.\"  I found her statement extremely hard to believe given what they tried to serve me.  Additionally, not that I need to say more, but they had run out of the coleslaw which was supposed to come with the fish and after we ordered instructed us that it was going to take longer than usual to get our food because they were backed up.  Honestly, the place wasn't even close to being busy!!

The is apparently the amount of time it takes me to forget that it really isn't fun. I made my yearly mistake today and regretted every minute I was there. The fun ends at the door where you aren't even allowed to bring in a bottle of water. We rented a tube only to be violently whistled by the lifeguard when my 6 year old sat on my lap in it. (ONLY ! PERSON ON A TUBE!!!) They don't allow any toys, masks, floaties, or anything that might cause a person to have fun while in the pool. I did see 1 group of kids with a tennis ball that 1 guard allowed but the next didn't. Acceptable behavior is constricted to standing, calmly in the water. Otherwise be prepared to have the guards all over you. Looking around I noticed there were 0 teens around. I grew up at this pool when there were diving boards including a 3meter board, but they have all been removed eons ago. Back then there were tons of teens around, we all hung out there but it seems they have realized there is little fun to be had there. Most of the people were like me, a single parent with a child under age 6. The kids appeared to be having fun. \n\nThe good things were that it wasn't crowded despite being the nicest day Pittsburgh has seen in a while and the water appeared to be clean. The bad was the deep end was closed for some reason, and the pavement around the pool will chew your feet to pieces. My feet seriously hurt after just 3 hours there. If you go make sure you bring shoes to walk from your towel to the pool. \n\nMy advice is that if you have children under age 9 they will probably have a good time. If you are looking to take a group of teens there forget it. They will be bored in about 10 minutes.", "date": "2015-07-28 20:56:34"}

It's in the North Hills region of suburbs, and has an extensive array of facilities and amenities.  I mostly use the park for its hiking trails and the large dog park.  The trails are mostly pretty easy, although they are not all well-marked.  \n\nThe dog park is spacious, and there are plans in the works for a separate dog park for small dogs (sometimes the dog park is very crowded, and occasionally there will be a dog that plays a little too rough.)  There is a water fountain for the dogs at the dog park during the warmer months, and there are also pooper scooper bags in case you run out.\n\nThe park also features a golf range, tennis courts, a swimming pool, canoe and kayak rentals, and a very popular ice-skating rink.\n\nThere are several facilities you can rent at North Park, including picnic groves, picnic shelters, and large buildings with professional kitchens, heat, and electricity.  I had my wedding in the North Park Lodge building.  I don't know what the fees are to reserve the small shelters, but the fee for the lodge was surprisingly reasonable -- I think that, with the $50 alcohol permit included, the total rental fee was around $300.  There's a lot of competition for the buildings, though, and you can't rent more than 11 months in advance (reservations for a given calendar year begin in January, and are first-come first-served -- if you're planning an event and want to use one of the county parks buildings, you should go to the county office building as early in the year as possible, and you should book the facility you want before signing any other contracts.)

Since then, I've made it a point to explore as many parks in the area as I can. My favorite place to spend the day: North Park.\n\nWhile it's not much for hiking, there is a TON to do. My advice: park near the OTB At the Boathouse in one of the lots or along road. \n\nFrom there, I like to take the five-mile walk around the lake. You're on a road (there are dedicated walk and bike lanes), but it's still nice to check out the scenery. And there are scores of shelters and fishing holes so you're bound to strike up a few conversations along the way.\n\nThe loop will bring you back to the OTB, which has a nice little deck that overlooks the water. It's also attached to the boathouse, where you can rent kayaks, canoes, paddle boards, and peddle boats by the hour. If you have your own kayak or canoe, there's a launch there as well. (Plus, there's an ice cream stand next door!)\n\nIf you're into ropes courses, there's a big one nearby as well--and a huge, fenced in dog park about 1/2 mile away.\n\nWhile you can't swim in the lake, you can hit the North Park pool just a few miles away. It's MASSIVE. I can't express this enough. You can rent an inner tube, you can swim laps, you can wade around, or (if you're a kid) you can go to the splash areas. But it's also cash only so make sure you don't roll up with credit cards.", "date": "2018-07-25 17:04:08"}

It's part of some dear childhood memories for me, riding bikes with my family and going to picnics with friends. I spent nearly every Friday night at the ice rink in junior high. In recent years I can count on running around North Park lake and having no doubt about how far I've gone. One lap = 5 miles. I recommend if you are going to do more than one lap, however, that you change directions your second trip around. The path tilts inward towards the lake ever so slightly and can beat up on your interior knee if you aren't careful. \n\nOn a nice day, there are always a ton of people walking, jogging, biking, pushing strollers, fishing, you get the idea. It can get congested. And there are spots on the loop that feel way too close to traffic. This can get a bit hairy with the cars coming down Ingomar Road. Slow down, people! For the most part, though, it's a safe and beautiful place to spend some time outdoors.\n\nThere are numerous events and 5Ks held in North Park every year.

I'm talking 3k plus acres big. The lake alone is over 60 acres. This park is very popular with the local communities. Some people visit on a very regular basis, almost religiously. There are many walkers, runners, and cyclists whom take advantage of the large 5 mile loop around the lake. The lake is utilized for fishing, kayaking, canoeing, and SUPing (stand up paddle boarding). It is also the backdrop in many selfies.\n\nThere are a few bathroom facilities located in the park, some permanent buildings, some portable bathrooms. I always bring snacks, and water when I visit the park, usually contained in a backpack.\n\nThere are numerous shelters throughout the park. Some are small, medium, large, and extra large. Some have electricity and/or handicap access. The price rages from 30 to 88 bucks (depending on size and if you are a resident). You can reserve the shelters online, up to a year in advance. Alcohol is allowed in non glass containers, only IF you complete the proper paperwork and pay the $50 fee ($63 for nonresident). \n\nIf you're too good for the shelters you can rent a 'facility' as the park calls it. They're pretty much entire buildings or the second floor of the boathouse. These range from free (a particular facility for scouts) or 40 to 313 bucks, plus any special fees that apply.\n\nReady for outside stuff? There are tennis courts, basketball courts, handball courts, deck hockey courts, baseball and softball fields, bike ramps and obstacles, and hiking trails.\n\nThis place is a wonderful place to enjoy the outdoors with a friend, or a hundred friends.", "date": "2017-07-16 16:24:05"}

It provides a scenic view and  gives me a chance to exercise and people watch, all at the same time! There are water fountains and outhouses located along the 5 mile route which is nice if they are needed.

It's beautiful and big, and I don't know what more you could possibly want from a Pennsylvania park.  Here is a summary of the random odds and ends I know about the park:\n\nRenting Pavilions/ Buildings:  I had my high school graduation party at the Ranch House, and everyone agreed that it was a perfect location.  The rent was low.  I think it was $200 for the entire day, which wasn't bad at all.  It had a giant yard, and we played kickball and softball with large teams.  There was a full kitchen as well, and the caterers loved the set up.  The large pavilions were around $75/day, and the small ones $25/day.  If you are interested in renting, you can rent up to a year in advance.\n\nPie Traynor Trail:  Pie Traynor is around 1.5 miles, I believe.  It's a shady walk along a one way street. There is one giant playground and the pool near the entrance.  There are a bunch of baseball field, a large grove, many little groves, multiple small playgrounds, woodsy trails, and the main walking trail along the road.  It's perfect for a short run or walk.  I love walking my poodle and maltese back here because it's less congested than the lake.  On the weekends, different groups often rent the area out for charity walks.\n\nThe Actual Lake and Boathouse:  You can rent pedal boats and, I think, canoes and kayaks as well at the boat house.  Since they just cleaned up the lake, this is fun to do on a nice day.  You can also fish in the lake, but they do check for permits here.  It's fun to sit on a bench and read by the lake as well.\n\nAround the Lake:  I ran cross country for many years around this lake.  If you are just starting training, don't start here.  There is a giant hill by the boathouse, and it's about five miles around.  It's a pretty run, but it tends to be a bit over crowded with bikes, dogs, walkers, etc.  But my friend and I always walk it after we go out to dinner and eat too much.\n\nNature Center:  This is off of the beaten path and cool.  There is a map of nearby trails, including a meadow, braille trail geared to blind people (at one time, at least.  It needs some maintenance now.), a stream path, pond trail, and numerous woods trails.  Definitely good for little kids.  They also do summer nature camps here for elementary aged kids.\n\nIce Skating:  In the winter, you can ice skate.  The end.\n\nSwimming Pool:  This is a really large county swimming pool.  There is a water slide, and I think diving boards, as well as a kid's mushroom sprinkler thing.  The pool is NOT heated so only good on a hot day.\n\nPar 3 Golf and Driving Range:  Reasonable prices.  Both are enjoyable and family oriented.\n\nMini Golf:  Good for kids or dates.\n\nBatting Cages:  Priced reasonably.  Old but totally functional.\n\nFood/Drink:  There is Chub's, which will clog your arteries and take ten years off of your life in a delicious way.  There is a little ice cream place and some other casual dining opportunities as well.  Sometimes, there are snow cone vendors near the boat house in the summer.\n\nGo Ape:  My 87 year old grandfather wants someone to take him on this ropes course.  It looks cool, but I'm not willing to let him try it.  If someone else will take him, let me know.  Haha.", "date": "2013-09-28 21:47:55"}

The older lady with the blonde hair in the back who apparently owns the place encourages and supports this unprofessional and rude behavior of her staff primarily because she's angry because her husband has been barred from working there due to his violent and threatening and irrational behavior towards women.

The rink is outside in a beautiful wooded park setting. It is well lit at night. They resurface the ice regularly during long skating sessions. The entrance to the ice rink is through a beautiful, old stone building. They have a very nice, heated building with skate rentals, snack bar, restrooms, lockers, video games, tables and benches. Outside, they have bleachers on the patio for spectators or a safe place to rest while you catch your breath and sip some hot cocoa. They offer many public skating sessions, and their prices are the lowest in the area for admission and rental. On Wednesday evenings they offer a one price for the entire family option. The facility is well maintained, clean, and well run by nice, seasoned professionals. They also offer skating lessons, host hockey tournaments, figure skating clubs, and do birthday parties. You won't find a better deal for family fun in the winter, or a great place to take a date!

If my research is correct, North Park is the largest park in Allegheny County.

It's home to lots of wildlife, too - I've been lucky enough to spot herons and even an osprey by the water! And surrounding the lake are acres and acres of woodlands. Between the water, the trees, and the more specialized areas of the park, there is literally something here for every visitor. Hiking, fishing, kayaking, golfing, swimming, ice skating, ball games, off-leash hotspots...it's all here! Access to some activities varies by season, but there's always something to do at North Park no matter the time of year.\n\nAs others have mentioned, the park is also well maintained and marked. Visits here are meant to be fun and stress free. Between its accessibility and its many options for visitors, I highly recommend that fellow outdoor lovers check out North Park at some point!\n\n(Pro-tip: Venture Outdoors often hosts hikes out here if you don't want to visit alone. And Kayak Pittsburgh operates a kayak rental on the gorgeous lake.)", "date": "2018-02-21 03:52:50"}

Although, they were very clear in what they said, it was what they did not say that was the most amazing. They fixed the interior door handle and the horn without question.

He always helped me find exactly what I needed, and even made recommendations for titles I could reference while working on my own creative projects. \n\nI recently decided it was important to allow myself more fun free-time activities, including getting back into regular comic book reading. Jeff happily holds issues of my favorite current series, and I now find myself really enjoying the ritual of driving to Arkham, chatting with Jeff and other customers, and walking out with a bag of comics to enjoy later. \n\nThere are larger stores in the area, and even some closer to my home. But their staff tend to range from indifferent to downright condescending, which is not at all the vibe I want from a place I go for fun! Arkham is the complete opposite - it's friendly to your typical male geeks, but feels safe and fun for women and young children as well. This seems like a no-brainer, but believe me - it is NOT the case everywhere!\n\nI highly recommend you pay Jeff a visit at Arkham for new comics, older comics, collectibles and even a good chat.

My car was not driveable so it had to be left at the shop. When I called for an estimate of when it would be looked at, I was told they were so busy and they couldn't give me an answer. When I pressed for an answer, the lady on the phone said probably three weeks at the earliest for it be even be looked at. Hearing this, I decided to take it elsewhere, to a place that could give me a set day that they would work on my car (Rob Wagner Auto Body is great and very helpful). I had a rental from Mascari, and wanted to drop it off ASAP since insurance was only paying 30 days. Since they own the gas station next door, I stopped there after the body shop was closed and asked if they could accept the return of a rental car; they said yes. A few days later, I received a call from insurance that Mascari would not release my car because I owed $150, for five days rental, when I only had it for two. When I stopped in the shop to pay, the girl at the front desk was cold and disrespectful and dismissive just because I was no longer getting the work done there. She said \"well you should have read the rental agreement because it says you are not allowed to turn rentals in after hours.\" Well then they need to educate all their employees on their policies since they said they were able to accept rental return. Overall, once they realized they were not getting the work, then turned petty and disrespectful and not helpful.

Worst florist experience EVER. I don't spend my time writing negative reviews, I like to reward quality service/positive experiences, check my history. But this business earned my first, because it was so devastatingly bad. \n\nMy wife & I needed a sympathy bouquet for the passing of a very close friend in Pittsburgh and decided to use a local florist that was part of the FTD network and offered a guarantee.  We thought, we'll ensure timely delivery and give a local 'Burgh business some support.  MISTAKE.  We ordered a tulip arrangement \"The FTD\u00ae Bright Lights\u0099 Bouquet\" and selected the \"Best\" option (i.e. most expensive).  $82.99 +delivery and tax for a total of $99.50.  Double the price of FTD internet sites, but again we're supporting a small business, in her hometown, so we felt good. And of course we wanted to honor the memory of her dear friend with the nicest floral arrangement we could get. WRONG. Check the picture, does that look like an almost $100 arrangement?  If you said \"Nope,\" you're right. It barley looks like their \"Good\" offer, check their website for yourself. It was delivered Sat (4/11) and by Mon AM (4/13) four tulips were dead!!!\n\nHORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE. So, of course, upon hearing & seeing how dreadful the arrangement turned out, my wife promptly called the florist first thing Monday morning to follow up on their guarantee. Surely, the owner/manager upon learning of a disatisfied customer would honor their statement: \"Please notify us within 24 hours if you are not satisfied with your order. We will work with you to find a solution to the problem.\"  WRONG AGAIN.  The owner not only refused to look at the picture, but refused to work toward any \"solution to the problem.\" On top of that, she was rude and claimed my wife knew nothing about tulips, unlike the owner with 20 years experience. My wife closed the conversation with, \"Let me get this straight, you've insulted me, you're refusing to look at the photograph of the flowers and could care less that I'm going to give a negative review. Basically, you refuse to help me in any way???\" and the response from the owner, \"I don't care if you post your review across the whole country...I don't need to see the arrangement, because I made the arrangement and there's nothing to fix.\" WOW! The arrogance left my wife stunned. \n\nSo Allison Park Flowers, thanks for ruining our sympathy bouquet gesture, embarrassing my family and then refusing to make it right. Ask yourself, did it really need to be this way?", "date": "2015-04-14 02:05:51"}

So I asked the employee (not katie) how much it was she told me it was 10 dollars I said ok that I wanted it and then told my mom how much it was and then the lady came over and talked to my mom and asked her if it was ok, which was the right thing to do. My mom said yes we wanted it she said ok, the employee told my mom that it would be 10 dollars plus tax and left. My mom got me the money (10 dollars and 70 cents) so I took it up and she informed me very rudly that it was $11.77 cents so I asked why and she said it was tax so I said ok and went and got my mom and she came up with me and asked her what was wrong and she said that it was 11.77. My mom told her that the lady that we talked to said it was only 10.00 she replied with \"IT IS $11.77\" my mom said ok and paid the extra money when we got in the car she took the clay figureen out of the bag and looked at it and the price on the bottom was $10.00.  As she was thinking about it she said if anything it should have been closer to $5.00, because we didnt paint it there.We didnt use her paint and she didn't have to fire it, so it should have been cheaper because she didnt have to do very much.

Eventually to deadens into a castle like structure which is OTB. It looks very nice from the outside sitting in front of the lake.  There is plenty of parking available.\n\nWe went in and there was a Weyerbacher Tap Takeover going on.  We were able to grab beers from the bar and quickly made our way outside to the patio on a nice Spring day. We sat around the fire ring (no fire) in some nice comfortable wooden chairs. We had a chance to talk with the Weyerbacher reps and they provided us with several beers to try free of charge. These were full size pints.  Now I know this isn't the normal restaurant's practice but it was their decision to bring these folks in and the main reason we decided to make the trip. Weyerbacher makes excellent beer!  Looking at their normal beer list, it appeared to be decent on the craft selection.\n\nAfter a few hours of drinking and longing on the patio we spoke with a hostess who sat us inside to eat. They are obviously known for their burgers and had a selection of several gourmet burgers at moderate prices. They also had appetizers and traditional sandwiches. I opted for the Heaven on Earth Burger which came with roasted red peppers, spinach, tomato, mozzarella and Sriracha ranch on the burger and a side of fries. The burger was a good size and delicious. I greatly enjoyed the burger. The fries were nothing great. I also ordered the Old Firehouse Dip with tortilla chips. It's was served warm and very tasty but on the small side. I would recommend it as an appetizer for no more than two.\n\nService here was quick and friendly for as busy as they were.

We had to get our son from school so we wouldn't have even had the luxury of asking to have them remade. When we left $40 for a check that was $33.06 the server brought back $6 in change. So our food was served  cold and soggy, no one ever even asks us how it was, our change was shorted, but the worst part is we sent 2 messages on Facebook (OTB doesn't have an email address or contact button on their website at least not when we visited it) about our experience and neither was even responded too even though both show as being seen. We'll take our business elsewhere in the future.", "date": "2018-05-30 01:35:06"}

Too bad we had abysmal service by the server, and a manager. We were greeted cheerfully, seated promptly, and our drink orders taken quickly. Within 10-15 minutes of our arrival, the deck was filled, and the quick service went downhill, along with my order's accuracy (3 times). \n\nWe ordered the North Ridge Nachos, and added grilled chicken ($3 more), for an appetizer. It was fresh and flavorful, with delicious, crisp tortilla chips, and so big, we only ate half, since we wanted to have dessert. It  could easily be a shared meal.  \n\nI had the Slow Ride Salmon Sandwich. First I had the wrong order(server), then the right order, but slathered in aioli which I ordered OTS (food runner), then a cold, but correct order (different food runner). The other person ordered Henry's Fish Tacos. I tried several bites. Bland. It was probably cod ( we asked, but the server wasn't sure, and the food runners had no idea), which is a very mild fish. However, it was tender, flaky, hot and huge. Our dinners each came with a big side of slaw, also slightly bland, but creamy. It needed zing...Caraway seeds, perhaps.\n \nFinally, the huge, homemade salmon cake arrived nestled in a fresh brioche bun, with lettuce, tomato, and dill aioli (OTS). The salmon cake was moist, done just right, and had fresh tomato and crisp lettuce with it. Loved the brioche bun. \n\nThe server, Grace, while very nice, was MIA for 90% of our meal, so we didn't order dessert (we had been there over 1 1/2 hours by that time). I told the manager, Jared. He was surprised about Grace, one of his most experienced servers, and 2 weeks later, I was sent a $20 gift card (by Melissa Voltz, Front of House/Bar Mgr.), which I thought was cheap. If I'm wrong, I hope someone straightens me out. When I go back (and not to this location) obviously I can't order much past my salmon sandwich, and certainly not 2 (red Sangria) drinks. Or dessert.\n\nOriginally, we ordered an appetizer ($12), 4 drinks (2 drinks each), my sandwich ($11.99), and fish tacos ($11.99). I brought this to Jared's attention, and he just said he was sorry for the bad experience, and understood my disappointment.

Their pizza is good, but doesn't stand out when there are so many great pizza places within a 20 minute drive.  But their seafood pizza is my favorite in the city, and always has a generous amount of shrimp and scallops.  The Italian dishes are good sized portions but fairly bland.  The last two times we ate in the restaurant, dishes were overcooked and had to be sent back to the kitchen.  My mother in law's lasagna was so clearly burnt that I couldn't believe it was even served.\n\nIt's a decent option to get a quick pizza for takeout, but I if you're looking to dine in somewhere there are plenty of better options nearby.", "date": "2017-10-28 21:51:07"}

Always thought the N Park boathouse was a beautiful building in need of a purpose. Decided to go on a Sunday afternoon just after 4, the hour between when they stop serving brunch and when they start dinner specials. What's up with that?\n\nNot overly crowded at all, which I knew thanks to NoWait. Several tables taken outside, in spite of temps in the high 40s. I'll take my gorgeous view just inside the glass thank you, where there's still heat. Grace, our waitress, told us to ignore the draft menu since she had an updated list. I had a 21st Amendment Toaster Pastry IPA draft, my companion had a bottled Miller Light. Grace told me it might take a few minutes for my beer since they were just changing kegs (thanks for the heads up). \n\nI ordered a WheelMill burger, medium, my friend, the fish sandwich. Though the burger was definitely not medium, it was good and not overcooked shoeleather. My companion really liked her enormous fish sandwich, that included enough house-made chips to feed everyone.\n\nIt was a crisp, cloudless fall day, and the lake setting was spectacular. Sure it's bar food, but it doesn't pretend to be more. I can't agree with the many posts regarding bad service - Grace was gracious ;) - but can only relay my experience on this day.

I've been hearing about Rocky's for years from my dad, who loves him some buffet.  He is pretty indiscriminate in his tastes, and my mom rolls her eyes just about every time the subject of Rocky's comes up.  But buffets are one of dad's passions, and Rocky's his is second favorite (to give a sense of scale, his favorite is that cooked by the high school kids at Beattie Tech).  \n\nI bet my dad will hear about this if Rocky reads this.  Rocky, if you are reading this, be patient, the story will get better as it goes!  During this first visit, I just didn't have the heart to write a review or the gumption to take any pictures.  I mean, who takes pictures of the Rocky's buffet?  The place is scattered with a handful of diehard locals and regulars.  There are no tourists, city folk, or young Yelpers up in the buffet's business taking pictures.\n\nI started with salad, scraping up the last few bits of spinach, but mostly iceberg; very few toppings, croutons, baby carrots.  There was a house dressing and a bottle sitting out.  There were some cheap dinner rolls like you get for 99c at Shop-n-Save, rectangular pulls aparts.  Oddly, there was a buffet pan with two flavors of potato chips.  I have a soft spot for chips but unfortunately they were starting to get soft.  There was chicken and a bunch of non-descript American meats, gnoochi in a simple red sauce, kielbasa, Normandy vegetables (the frozen blend of broccoli, carrots, & cauliflower).  There were tater tots that were a little soggy, not crisp.  \n\nMy other half &I had been having a bad day, and we found ourselves being inexplicably revived by this awful buffet.  We were baffled.  We both felt comforted.  Somehow.\n\nWhen I started eating the tater tots, I commented that I hadn't eaten them since I was a kid.  My other half replied that he hadn't eaten them since he'd had them in the school cafeteria.  Then we looked at each other and had our Ah Ha moment: this was school cafeteria food!  This is why even though we were eating stuff we hadn't eaten in many years, and wouldn't normally choose or even crave, we were enjoying it and were comforted.  For both of us, raised in different areas, it mirrored the food of our childhoods.\n\nThis is why I didn't review the first time: how do you quantify an experience like that?  That by our normal measures, would get a scathing one star (even though we went in with low expectations) but for a constellation of swirling reasons, was exactly what we needed that day?\n\nI shouldn't have worried.  Dad, having been successful in getting the kids to Rocky's once, was on a mission for a repeat visit.  He got the schedule of buffet themes, and of Italian, German, and Polish, we picked Polish food.\n\nSo the family trip to Rocky's Polish buffet was scheduled two weeks in advance.  My parents said that in the past Rocky's mom, whom they call Mama, made the pierogies.  They had heard she hadn't been well, so we were prepared for Mrs. T's (but my opinion was that even Mrs. T's would be better than the cheap knock-offs that my parents buy in plastic bags).  My parents were excited when Mama greeted us at the door, but dissapointed when the pierogies were perfect half circles.  But hey, these pierogies were great, and they were so good, I at them for dessert.  (Probably has to do with the fact that when I eat pierogies at home I boil them with kale.  Mama on the other hand served them as they should, with onions and butter).  They were too the moon awesome.\n\nThe other stand-out dish was the sarma/golumpki/stuffed cabbage.  Neither other half nor I are big meat eaters, but these were tasty golumpkis.  The meat was moist and flavorful, the cabbage was tender, and there was plenty of red sauce.  There was also halushki, kielbasa, and baked ziti.  For dessert I had strawberries.  The Polish buffet was an all-around satisfying experience.  This folks, is a genuine slice of Pittsburgh worth trekking to.  It's not high cuisine but if you can't handle how the hipsters have taken over Lawrenceville, head out to Shaler, where they haven't made any inroads at Rocky's.", "date": "2017-07-21 15:17:13"}

Great views with a very cool atmosphere. They have Adirondack chairs, umbrella tables, and even a fire pit on the patio. My brother and I ate dinner outside despite the cooler Spring weather. Luckily, we were seated under one of the many kerosene heaters. The food was good, pretty standard. We both ordered burgers and fries. The waitress talked me into trying the The Dirt Rag Delight, which is a bacon cheeseburger with Wholey's peanut butter and dill pickles. It was unlike anything I've had before. My brother had 'The Thick' and said it was good as well. They had a nice selection and variety of foods to choose from. Next time I think I'll try something else, like the fish tacos. I had a decent mojito, it wasn't in a large glass and still cost $7 which was a bummer.\n\nSadly, service wasn't the best. When we arrived we were told there would be a 30 minute wait. So naturally we headed to the bar for a drink. Literally two minutes later they called us and said our table was ready. We hadn't even ordered drinks yet. I'm not complaining that we were seated quickly. But I watched two groups leave when they were told there was a wait. I'm not sure why they were purposely turning customers away, since there were 8 tables visibly available. It was very strange. Our waitress was okay, we had to wait about 15 minutes for her to bring the check. If I had to guess they were understaffed and training some new employees.\n\nOverall this was a cool place. I'd go back just for the view and atmosphere. It's kind of a great oasis away from the hustle and bustle of the city.

So, I made sure to take my receipt and even an image of the dead tree to the store so that I could get a \"fast and easy\" refund. After driving all the way to the store and waiting in line, an associate told me that one must physically bring the dead item back to the store with a receipt to get a refund. I couldn't believe this ridiculous policy, and I don't remember reading this fine print anywhere on the website or on store signage. I then drove all the way back home, dug out the dead tree, and drove back to the store. After waiting in line again, I asked a rude cashier if I could have a refund for this tree. She told me, \"not from me, nope, na-uh.\" I am not sure why any associate would talk to a customer in this manner. She then rudely said \"go to returns\" without giving any instructions as to where that was located. I then dragged the dead item all the way through the store to the return desk, where a gentleman was just finishing his transaction, which ended in awkward silence. I asked for a refund for my item and received it without any interaction with the associate. The associate also failed to say thank you or generally make me want to come back to the establishment. The transaction ended in awkward silence. \nI am not sure if the employees at Home Depot are trained in any way to respect customers or treat them like people, but I will surely think twice before returning to Home Depot. I feel a little cheated, because I have spent a lot of money at the corporation to be treated this way. Now I simply go to Lowe's (where I bought a replacement tree).

I'm paying MORE for LESS food? What kind of backwards logic is that? Instead of getting ripped off, I decided to just go with their house salad and add on the black bean cakes. Nothing worth writing home about but I do commend them for offering a healthy vegetarian protein substitute. \n\nOverall, this place earned 2.5 (let's round up to 3) stars from me.

I have a dealer that watches for bargains. I only get a new used car about every 10 years. So last spring I get a call, that a 2003 Lexus 430 SC with 30,000 miles was available. I was overdue for  a trade, and in my advancing years wanted a hard top convertible, actually I had grown a bit weary of having to repair the ragtop of my BMW 325. Since CleanTown USA opened, I've taken my cars there. The staff has always been attentive, managers were thoughtful and sincerely wanted to know if the cleaning had been done well. No one ever hesitated to go back over an area to spiff it up if it had been missed.\n\nI took the Lexus there yesterday. Had the deluxe wash and interior cleaning. I got into the car and came home. Every few days I carefully wipe the road dust off the car. When I came home yesterday, I did a quick wipe to admire the clean car, before the next rain. \"Ahhh!, there is something all over 1/2 of the trunk. It looks like a chemical that changed the surface of the paint!\" I garage my car at home and work. I could only think something had happened at the car wash, otherwise I would have surely seen this heartbreaking change in the appearance of a car immaculately kept. I called CleanTown. Without hesitation the said to bring it out. I was met by Ryan and Dan, two of the managers. They diagnosed the change due to drippings through concrete in work's parking garage {Shadyside Hospital]. They told me of several products that might help, and the risks to using some of them. Then they took the time to try a number of products to restore the disfigured paint, the first two efforts didn't due to well. Ryan said he thought he knew just what to use that would be safe. He retrieved a squeeze bottle from the wash area and went to work. Wow! The chemical reaction on the clear coat was gone! He kindly finished clearing every splatter, waxed the area and sent me on my way, very relieved!\n\nI will be back of course, and this spring I will have Ryan's crew due restoration on the finish of the whole car. I promise you that this isn't an advertisement, just a happy, evermore loyal CleanTown fan. Thanks so much guys!\n\nLee", "date": "2017-01-20 20:25:03"}

Lots to love, lots to hate. As with other reviewers, I agree that the concept is great, but the execution is horrible. I think they grossly underestimated how popular this place would be. The kitchen just isn't the right size for the demand for food. This is why people have to wait so long for tables, even when several are open. They just can't keep up with the demand. \n\nFood... It's generally pretty good. We've had a few hiccups, but nothing that hasn't happened elsewhere. \n\nWe are beer drinkers, so we really like the draft and bottled beer selection. The bartenders are knowledgeable about the beers (the table servers, less so). \n\nAtmosphere... Can't be beat. The outside patio in summer is THE place to be. Adirondack chairs invite you to sit and chill out while you enjoy the view of the lake, while the kayaks, canoes, paddle boards, and the occasional pedal boat come and go at the rental place right next door. \n\nBathrooms... TERRIBLE. This is the reason for the 2 rating. The women's restroom always smells like raw sewage, and the paper towel dispensers are rarely filled. Instead, they just set a roll out on the counter, which results in one or both edges being saturated from sitting in water. To make matters worse, the bathroom serves park goers as well as restaurant patrons, and has a door that opens to the outside. This is a sexual assault waiting to happen. \n\nOn our last visit, I went I to the bathroom at the same time as a server. She did not wash her hands after using the bathroom. \n\nIn conclusion... I REALLY want this place to get its act together. I'm just not sure they can overcome the negatives.", "date": "2014-08-30 23:45:20"}

This place is always packed on a nice day so make sure to use the no wait app! \n\nThe food here is very underwhelming. I normally order the Rachel Carson wrap and it has a sad piece of lettuce on it and a small portion of chicken compared to pita ratio but it is better then most things I've had here. I do enjoy the hand cut chips that come with the wrap though! \n\nService here is nothing special either. Hostesses are awkward and not welcoming. Servers always seem to be overwhelmed and none of them are very personal or go out of their way to be friendly.

It is a great addition to North Park and the North Hills.  Located in the old Boathouse, it is a great reinvention of an old spot.  The architecture of the building is classic, intricate and beautiful and the location right on the edge of North Park Lake is stunning.  I promise when you are sitting on their deck, underneath one of their large, red umbrellas you will feel far, far away from Pittsburgh.\n\nThe food is delicious and tries to lean towards the healthier side of things, but there's definitely some sinfully delicious items.  The \"Rachel Carson Wrap\", named after a famous Pennsylvanian ecologist, is their version of buffalo chicken wrap with grilled chicken, buffalo sauce, blue cheese dressing on a soft, warm delicious pita.  Definitely recommend if you're a fan of some spice like myself.  Recently I tried the Lakeside Salad which features mixed greens with a HUGE filet of salmon with goat cheese, craisins and candied walnuts with housemade balsamic vinaigrette.  It was delicious and surprisingly VERY filling.  Other things to check out...their caprese Panini and housemade potato chips with a hint of ranch flavoring dusted on.\n\nPretty much the only reason I'm not giving five stars is sometimes the service can be a little slow.  Last time cashing out our check took an incredibly long time, and for another table near us took almost 20 minutes and them asking multiple servers for help.  It is always busy here (plan to get here early, especially on a beautiful day!) but they should plan their staffing accordingly.\n\nOverall, a MUST do if you are in the North Park area!", "date": "2015-05-06 23:41:49"}

They may have been understaffed. I only noticed 2 servers on the patio taking orders so maybe that is the reason. Another reason for thinking of 3 stars is the menu really isnt too big. It has nice options (appetizers, salads, burgers, sandwiches) but it just didnt have too many options. It is a burger bar so i'll give i'll forgive it for not having a ton of entrees.\n\nAnyways, the atmosphere made up for everything.

It'd be nice to see some healthier options besides just salads though as well as some more creative options for people looking to try new things.

Finally got a chance Saturday.\nReally great atmosphere, love the look of the bar. The first sign of trouble however was that their 12 tap system was half empty. Second sign was that the restaurant itself was pretty empty as well. Especially for a Saturday night. We we're seated promptly and addressed quickly by our waitress. My wife decided to try the Sangria. It was little more than white wine with some berries thrown in it. Watered down and not very good. Had the pretzel and cheese appetizer. Pretzels were great, but the beer cheese had no flavor. For entrees we selected the lobster roll and chicken and waffles. \nLobster roll was a little on the chewy side and tasted just slightly \"off\". The chicken and waffles was covered in a dull flavorless gravy that rendered it inedible. My son had chicken tenders and fries that tasted as if the oil they were fried in needed changed.\nAll in all, a disappointment and at a price point that is only justifiable if the food were fantastic.\nThe menu is interesting, but was not executed well.\nAdditionally, we were told one of the beers on the limited draft list was out, then heard the waitress telling another table that an item on the menu had not been available for months, a beer they wanted was not available, and when delivering the bottle beer they ordered she said, \"That's the last one\".\nIt's a shame to see another locally owned non chain restaurant not executing like this.", "date": "2017-04-02 21:41:04"}

I love North Park and run there quite often. Imagine my delight when I found out the old boathouse was being given new life by the good, veggie friendly folks at OTB! What a great idea with so much potential!\nWe decided to go one Friday afternoon for some light bites. It was a warm afternoon and plenty of people were sitting on the gorgeous patio over looking North Park lake. We waited quite a lengthy bit of time for the host to seat us, despite there being open tables and only one party in front of us. We weren't in a hurry, so this wasn't a huge issue, but I did take note of how unorganized things seemed. The space was limited from the start, as they worked inside the footprint of the boathouse. This means indoor seating is limited and somewhat cramped, so we were happy to sit outdoors and take advantage of the view and sunshine. The patio is adorable and welcoming, with a fire pit and adirondack chairs placed near the dining tables. We looked over the menu and decided to get a few appetizers. The seitan wings in sweet chili barbecue flavor and the \"Tangled Spokes\", or soft pretzels with beer cheese. The restaurant was pretty busy, but our waitress was noticeably absent for most of our dining experience. We had to flag somebody down to get napkins and silverware. The food was good, about what I'd expect knowing what the original OTB is capable of. The boathouse menu seemed smaller to me, but there was still a few veggie sandwiches I'd be happy to try. My only real complaint about this place was the service. Our waitress could have turned over our table rather quickly if she had been paying attention. One of my dining pet peeves is waiting forever for the check. Which we did. I don't enjoy feeling like a restaurant is holding me hostage. I would have loved to given this OTB a four star review based on just the food and beautiful setting. But the service knocked it down a notch. When we finally left the line waiting for seating was literally out the door. I can't even imagine how long those poor people waited, since the tables weren't being turned over efficiently. I hope they can get the kinks worked out, because this will be a killer spot if they can pull it together.", "date": "2013-11-11 00:02:09"}

Once for breakfast, twice for lunch and once for dinner.  All four times the meals are \"Meh\".  Things that are supposed to be hot are cold (like coffee and french fries).

The draft selection isn't huge but they had a variety. I chose the boathouse sangria which was sweet and smooth and lovely for a day like today. We ordered their pretzel app. The pretzels come from the Pittsburgh pretzel company on the south side and boy were they good. Doughy and not too salty. The cheese dip was light and yummy. I chose the biker babe burger but I got turkey burger instead. It was yummy. A fresh, delicious burger topped with avocado, bacon, and a fried egg. The hubby got the fish sandwich, Panco encrusted.

We were Dodos and forgot to mention the nut-sesame allergies till after we put in the order. Had called ahead and the staff had spoken to the kitchen and felt they could definitely handle this type of allergy. The server (T.C.-a gentleman) said that the burger was on the way out but they would remake the burger just to be absolutely sure there was minimal chance of contamination. No guarantees of course, as there can always be an accident, but to the best of their ability they wanted to make sure we had a safe meal.\n\nJust Wow. If everyone were as careful and considerate as this Gentleman Server, the world would just be a Million times better!!!\n\nHad the Fish tacos with chips, which were quite good. The aioli has a serious kick to it. It's interesting food. (Unfortunately, part of the soft tortilla was a little hard.)\n\nKids had burger (they were not sure about the allergen content of the bun but were sure about the burger and fries being OK) and mini-corn dogs. The kids were both pleased. The older child (8) does not hesitate to order off the adult menu (as in filet mignon medium rare if available) but liked the burger description. Does not hesitate to criticize food. He liked his burger and fries a lot. So that means something. The Kids meals came on/with a Frisbee. Which really made the kids happy! They already want to go back!\n\n\n\nDefinitely recommend! And we will be back!", "date": "2017-07-16 04:37:50"}

I have sent emails to them, asking why they just don't instruct the cleaners to do the inside windows twice.....that's what I do on my windows at home and when I do the inside windows of the car.

The restaurant was quaint and very nicely decorated. I would consider this casual upscale dining. There wasn't a crowd around 6pm and we were promptly seated. Having never been here before I wasn't sure what to expect. \n\nI started with their soup of the day, Roasted Red Pepper, and it was phenomenal. Went great with the warm bread they brought out. We ordered the fish tacos as a starter and when they say \"Small Plates\" on the menu, they weren't kidding. We got three bite-sized fish tacos. Very small, but good. Since the soup was fairly filling we ordered the BBQ Trio to share. It was beautifully presented coming with a slice of beef brisket on top of corn bread, 3 BBQ ribs over coleslaw, and BBQ Pulled pork over rice and beans. Of the three, the pulled pork was our favorite. The ribs were decent and the brisket and cornbread were both a little dry for my liking. But when it comes to barbecue, I like A LOT of sauce so maybe I'm just picky. The coleslaw that came with the ribs seemed like more of a garnish than an actual coleslaw. \n\nOverall, it was a good experience. A lot of the menu items sounded really good so I'd love to go back and try some more! They also have an outdoor patio out back that might be nice on the off chance it isn't raining.", "date": "2015-07-15 18:36:55"}

We also chose Wild Sage for our Valentine's day dinner because of your posted menu online. We were a little disappointed to find a different menu last evening. I understand that finer restaurants commonly do this but my belief is that adding a couple bucks to similar dishes on a 'holiday' menu is a little iffy. We had decided on entrees even before we left the house but fortunately we saw dishes that sounded good on the 'special' menu.\n\nWe were seated soon after we arrived for a 7:30 reservation after a table had been bussed. A tall man, I presume the owner. Came over and asked us if we had ever been there before to which we replied 'no, but we came to Spadafore's a lot'. He conveyed to us that he hoped that we had a pleasant experience. The waitress came over a short time later, a young blonde woman, who I reluctantly have forgotten her name, took our wine order. When she brought our drinks and bread she took our order, we both had Caesar salads and the filet. My wife ordered hers medium well and I ordered mine medium rare. We received our salads in good time and although somewhat sparse of romaine or additional ingredients, the presentation was beautiful and the taste was very good, the crusted bread circle was a nice touch. \n\nWe also received our entrees in good time after our salads were finished. I noticed upon cutting into my steak that it seemed slightly over cooked, my wife felt hers was slightly under cooked, so we exchanged them. I believe they were both cooked to medium. However, the taste was pretty good and we both enjoyed our meal. The mashed potatoes were a bit cold however. Regardless, we both had a nice dinner, albeit we felt slightly overpriced. \n\nThe slight issue we had was with service along with the overpricing. Though our waitress was mildly pleasant, she never once came back to the table to see if everything was OK. Not once did she ask us how is the wine, or how are the salads, or how are the filets and were they prepared to order. At the end of our meal she only asked if there would be anything else. Not a 'would you like coffee or dessert'? She brought our check and said thank you, without an 'I'll take that when you're ready'. All with just a slight smile. We wondered if she was having a bad day. I watched another waitress (a petite brunette), throughout our meal and she treated her patrons with extreme politeness, a terrific smile, and attended to them frequently. Our feelings are that a finer restaurant, and by their price structure it seems that's what you are striving for, I would hope to have top quality service from the time we are greeted at the door until we leave. I think our waitress just needs to be better trained and she'll probably do fine. \n\nAt a finer place every aspect of the meal should be a perfect as possible. Meat should be prepared as ordered, not a 'happy medium'. Mashed should not have a slight chill to them. Maybe these details seem too critical for some people but when my wife and I go out to a better restaurant, especially on a day like Valentine's day, we expect top quality from our $100 tab. \n\nThe restaurant was crowded with every table seated but that is not an excuse for a small, intimate place from getting things right. The atmosphere was relaxed enough for our server to pay more attention and our meals to have been perfect. I also understand that nothing is perfect, even the service and food at every table at a nicer restaurant.\n\nAs a small business owner myself I would want to know any and every way I could improve my work from my customers. Repeat business is key to sustained success.\nAs I said, this note is intended to give them feedback in order to improve, and not a request for a compensatory meal. I truly wish Wild Sage restaurant all the future success at this location as it is good to have a better place to eat around the area. We may even come back again, at least after our experience last night recedes in our minds. All in all, it wasn't terrible. It just needed some attention to detail. I would give it 3 out of 5 stars, but hopefully if we do return they will take the steps to earn a 5 out of 5.", "date": "2015-02-15 23:30:05"}

I think OTB is a nice change of pace.\n\nOur first visit was not so good.  But we did make the mistake of visiting during their first week.  The kitchen was not putting out food and people were pretending not to mind the long wait.  Another nuisance was OTB serving all the kiddies meals on Frisbee's.  It was not pleasant watching small children assault each other and all the patio furniture with plastic discs.  When we finally got our food, it was decent.  My corn chowder was awesome.  Almost as good as the kind my mother and big brother used to make.  I also got a grilled cheese.  It was good.  BJ got a BLT.  Our sides were good, coleslaw and super yummy fries.\n\nNext visit, we kept it simple.  BJ got the Seitan wings with chili soy.  He thought they were tasty.  He also liked that they were served with pita wedges and carrot and celery sticks.  I got chicken tenders.  They were heavily breaded and very crispy.  Another thing we like about OTB, they had a nice selection of seasonal pumpkin beers right now.\n\nThe best part of visiting is the patio.  And it's the main reason for the 4 stars.  The fire pit is great and so are the Adirondack chairs.  And you get an incredible view of the lake.  Also, all the staff is very friendly.  And so are the ever present owners.

We had the chance to go out for a \"grown up\" dinner last night while the grandparents watched the kids.  Last year we went downtown but I found Wild Sage on Yelp and liked that it was less than a mile away.  And I loved the menu options...not a boring item to be found!\n\nWild Sage was easy to find and parking was no problem.  When we arrived there was just one group of women sitting at the bar. The owner greeted us right away and gave us the cozy table for two in the corner.  Before we knew it, almost all the tables were full...on a Tuesday night!\n\nWe started out by sharing the Goat Cheese and Pear Salad and the Lobster Crepe - both very good choices.  The salad had ample crumbled goat cheese and candied pecans on a bed of crisp spring mixed greens.  And the crepe was stuffed with sweet lobster in a sauce that was rich, but not overly so, with saut\u00e9ed red onion strips on top. We sopped that sauce up with the fresh bread that had been provided to us...it was too good to just leave it there.  The plate was sent back nearly clean.\n\nFor entrees, he had the Osso Bucco and I had the Braised Beef Short Ribs.  He called his the \"Flintstone Dinner\" because the pork shank was huge!  The meat fell off the bone and combined perfectly with the penne in a flavorful red sauce.  My beef was tender and rich with flavor.  I expected the accompanying polenta to be in a pile like mashed potatoes or sliced but instead it was long, thin triangles that must have been pan fried to a light crisp on the outside with a creamy center.  They were a bit salty, but other than that they were quite delicious.\n\nI couldn't even finish my meal but I was dying to try the creme brulee.  I was warned that it wouldn't be pretty if I took it To Go because it would have to be scooped out of the dish...and she was right.  But it was SO good anyway.  There were bits of crispy, sugary burnt top mixed in with the creamy, smooth interior.  They had divided it up into two little containers...one for me, one for my Mother in Law who was home watching our kids.  Letting her have the second serving after I had had mine was one of the most difficult things to do.  I *really* didn't want to share that awesomeness!\n\nSorry I don't have pictures to share...we kept diving in to our dishes as soon as they were set down...! It wasn't a quick dinner but that's not what we were looking for.  It was a very pleasant atmosphere...unrushed, not too loud, European decor, lights were dimmed but it wasn't dark, very welcoming overall.  Jenn, the owner/hostess/waitress had at least 8 tables to take care on her own but she was always on top of it all.  She checked on us often and I could see her constantly looking over the room to make sure everyone was happy.  \n\nTwo negatives: 1) the reviews here include mentions/pictures of menu items that are no longer available that I would have loved to have tried (but there were still so many options that we took forever to make our choices) and 2) it's six hours from our house. But we will be back next time we are in Pittsburgh!", "date": "2015-12-30 16:26:51"}

Staff were disinterested at best and rude at worst. We waited 45 minutes for a table only to be seated outside under a heater. After 5 minutes the heater went out. We asked our waitress to turn it back on and she didn't come back for 15 minutes and even then her answer was \"Oh I don't know I told them about it.\" The table next to us was so cold they just left. (Our appetizers, the pretzel and zucchini rolls, are already cold at this point.) Another server came by and we asked her and she snapped something about how she told our server already that they're out of propane so there's nothing they could do. We responded, okay can we be reseated inside or near another a heater? Somewhat reluctantly she agreed. In my opinion they should have apologized for the inconvenience and promptly offered to reseat us-- it was about 50 degrees out after all. \n\nInside it took nearly 45 minutes for our food to arrive and even then it was only after we finally flagged down and asked our server if she would check on our order. She delivered the food like a hit and run, didn't even stay long enough for us to order drink refills or inquire about the missing salad dressing. 3 out of 4 of the meals were great.. Though a bit cold. The 4th was a burger that was ordered well and was delivered raw in the middle. We didn't bother sending it back as we couldn't find our server until everyone else was done with their meal and at this point we'd been there for over two hours.\n\nIn their defense I do feel our server was 90% of the issue. I could overhear other servers giving what sounded like great, attentive service. Asking customers if they'd like refills, how their food was, etc. Ours didn't offer a single refill or inquire about anything. On the way out we finally found her chatting it up and having a grand time with the hostess, maybe that's where she's been the whole night? \n\nIf I ever decide to go back, the bean cake appetizers were tasty and the views are great, I'd go at lunch in hopes of it being warmer (no heaters necessary), them still having the iron city bites (which they'd run out of the night we went), and also with the hope of having a less distracted, more focused server.", "date": "2014-04-30 15:39:52"}

The location is absolutely beautiful! The building is gorgeous and sets on a very picturesque lake. It's a perfect spot to dine outdoors during nice weather.\n\nOTB offers burgers, sandwiches, salads, and bar food. Plus they have a pretty good beer list. I didn't get to try much from the menu, as we had dinner plans coming up, but I did try the Peel-Out Pierogies, which were really tasty, and the North Ridge Nachos, which were pretty good. \n\nIf you're checking out North Park, I think OTB is a great place to stop for a bite or a drink.", "date": "2018-03-20 14:58:07"}

At the old location, a Joe's Special was never really a Joe's Special (crust was always too thin, and not as much cheese as the original from McKnight Rd).  Also, the regular crust pizza is pretty true to the original Monte Cello's.\nIt's a  pretty good bet to go with one of their pizzas.\n-the shrimp in my dad's entree were huge, delicious, and appeared to be hand-breaded.\n-wife said the eggplant parmesan was good.\n-daughter said her spaghetti with meatballs/sausage was good.\n-side salads, bread, and soups were pretty good.\n\nMonte Cello's are franchised.  As such, I assume the owner of each particular restaurant is trained in the food prep of the original Monte Cello's.  Sometimes they get it right, sometimes they don't.\n\nThe bad:\n-father in law got the fish sandwich with fries.  Fries were overcooked and served cold.\n-stuffed shells were bleh.  Standard fare like you'd get at Costco.  Certainly didn't taste homemade.\n-the lasagna was absolutely atrocious.  I tasted it and my daughter tasted it.  It tasted like something that had been in a freezer for about a year, absorbed the odors of all of the food around it, then was re-heated.  Terrible.  Worse than terrible.  We each took one bite and didn't eat the rest of it.  Stouffer's from your local grocer's freezer is ten times better than this stuff.\n\nIt took a really long time after we ordered to receive our entrees.  Certainly not the server's fault, though.  He was excellent.\n\nI hope this place gets its act together with the freshness of some of the food.\n\nI'll go back, but I'm sticking with the pizza for now.", "date": "2011-10-22 18:33:13"}

Our family and friends (addresses that were provided on the list, NOT phone numbers) were called on the phone and badgered to schedule an appointment where the card would be delivered in person.

The last time I walked by this place they were still closed and I kind of just pictured it as a little average cafe. I mean, can you blame me when the subtitle in their name is \"Bicycle Cafe\"? I've never been to the original OTB, either, so I didn't have an experience there to give me any expectations about this place.\n\nSo today when I walked in after kayaking I was surprised to find a very chill and welcoming dining area with music playing near the bar and a bustling patio. The menu impressed me, too; I tend to expect fried finger foods from park dining areas but instead I found a full burger and sandwich focused menu with lots of vegetarian-friendly options. And there were tons of healthy side dish options on the menu, too.\n\nGiven how busy the patio was my companion for the day and I opted to sit inside, which really wasn't a problem; the patio and indoors area aren't really separated by much more than a roof over your head, so we could enjoy a great breeze and were still far enough from the bar and speakers that the noise of the indoor area wasn't a problem.\n\nAnd not only was the atmosphere great, the food was pretty delicious. I had a slightly spicy and perfectly cooked turkey burger with fruit salad on the side; I also shared the black bean patty cakes with my dining companion and I thought they were absolutely perfect. (My companion thought they could have been a little crispier, but not me!) They were so tasty, especially once I added the amounts of Pico De Gallo, pinapple, guacamole and sour cream that I wanted. I partnered a Raspberry Summer Tea (Raspberry vodka and lemonade) with my meal and have to say, combined it was all a fantastic way to round out a beautiful summer day by the lake.\n\nMy only true complaint is with the bathrooms - the cafe's attached to the public park bathrooms, and, well...the public park bathrooms are as horrendous as you might expect public park bathrooms to be. I couldn't get out of there fast enough and it's a shame that those bathrooms have to be affiliated with this place at all.\n\nBut other than that, no complaints whatsoever - great atmosphere, great service, tasty food, and a nice place to relax after walking or kayaking in the park.

I was told that I should be able to get out the door for about $40 altogether.  \n\nI then called this location & set an appointment.

They did let me use the phone to call a dealer & I confirmed that my car was covered + set an appointment.  I went to check-out & was charged about the same $70 as I had paid last year at the dealer, even though the other MONROE I had called told me it would be about $40.  I decided I wanted to leave ASAP & just paid it without arguing.  If I got it fixed, Monroe would re-inspect the failed part & just charge me for a sticker.\n\nA week later I returned un-announced & was told they could get to my car in a FEW minutes.\nWhen a few turned into 20, I had to leave, but did set another appointment for the next day. I'd estimate I was there a total of 40 minutes.  i was charged $6 for the new sticker + for \"shop fees\" of 10% for just pulling off one wheel.  My $40 inspection turned into about $76 all told.\n\nSince my car is under manufacturers warranty for three more years, I'll only be going to a dealer for repairs & most maintenance (so as not to invalidate the warranty) & I've learned that there are lots of other options for future inspections.", "date": "2016-09-18 21:56:39"}

I had bookmarked it based on some pretty stellar reviews and was excited to check out their fusion sushi rolls.  The place was pretty crowded for a chilly Sunday night and we were seated right away. \n\nWe had no idea it was BYOB but quickly changed up our sake mindset to hot tea instead.  The tea had a really nice sesame flavor.  \n\nFor dinner, we ordered up some King Salmon Sushi pieces and three rolls - a rainbow, an iron chef, and a paradise.  They were all pretty tasty but were cut into HUGE pieces that made it ridiculously impossible to eat in one bite or try and gracefully take half a bite using chop sticks.  Comical but sort of a put off because you want the full flavor of the components of the roll and not piecemeal bits and bites.  Our favorite was the rainbow roll.\n\nThe King Salmon was really terrific!  Try that for sure. \n\nWe may go back another time but, honestly, it didn't blow our doors off.  The service was fine but not very helpful.  We asked what the special rolls were and were told they are always they same, Ocean and some other roll name she rattled off and then scurried away.  Maybe she could have sold us more on what the rolls were or what she would recommend.  That would have been a better approach.\n\nGive it a try.

Here's what I learned since from Monro's customer service rep: (1) Monro's policy requires ALL customers to provide an address as condition of service.  In other words, my experience was not unique to the franchise I visited; (2) Monro claims it uses the customer's address to organize its records to retrieve work sheets, billing info, etc and (3) it uses customers' addresses to mail promotional material to past customers. \n\nIn my opinion that explanation is not sufficient to change my mind about this Monro and its practices.  Monro can organize customer records using customer last name or license plate identifier and simply ask customers IF they actually want direct mail promotional material sent to them before asking asking for the address.  \n\nExperts recommend against providing such personal information. The FTC advises against all unnecessary disclosure of personal info as a safeguard against phishing and identity theft.  Link provided:  \nhttps://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0272-how-keep-your-personal-information-secure\n\nLikewise womens' advocacy groups advise women concerned with stalking to keep home addresses private unless absolutely necessary. Link provided:\n\nhttp://www.womenslaw.org/simple.php?sitemap_id=178\n\nBefore updating this review I checked Monro's privacy policy.  They don't appear to have one concerning customer info on file at its stores.  The corporation has a privacy policy concerning information stored on its website but I could find nothing about Monro's obligations to secure customer information acquired elsewhere. If my information is incorrect, maybe Monro can provide additional information. \n\nThere you have it.

I told the girl what vaccinations my dog needed, and the prices agreed upon during my first call with them, however when she returned with the medications it was obvious she did not listen to me and was going to inject my dog with something unnecessary - a reason why all veterinarian practices should review any/all available paperwork!    This place did not even verify who my dog was nor her past vaccinations had she had any to begin with!  \n\nFurthermore, since the costs agreed to over the phone over a week ago were not acceptable - the girl abruptly left the room and several minutes later another representative - Erica - entered the room and asked, \"What is your (my) problem?\"  She did not introduce herself, and was more than confrontational in her approach.  Do these people realize that our pets are our kids and that we also experience anxiety when taking our fur babies in for shots?  Bad enough they took her out of the room...to do???  Never once in my pups's 11 years has she been taken out of sight at any vets!\n\nOverall, I spent almost $100 at this \"low cost\" clinic plus an additional $20 for gas to get to this place with the impression that I would be saving a significant amount of money - not the case!  \n\nDefinitely not high quality nor the lowest possible cost!  And possibly a case of fraud.\n\n###\n\nAnd in response to your reply, I disagree with everything you have said because you were not there and a response based on hearsay cannot be validated as truth.  I would have never wasted my time driving so far had I known your clinic was going to up-charge everything \"a la carte\" because I could have spent the same where I live without the additional driving expense.

I ordered the Thai Style Crab Rangoons as my appetizer, which I highly recommend. So the rangoons themselves were kind of what you'd expect, but the sauce was so unexpected and it elevated them to a whole different level. The dipping sauce was an earthy, curry-type sauce, which made this dish stand out from any other crab rangoon or wonton I've ever had anywhere else. For my sushi rolls, I ordered the Whiter Geisha and the Iron Chef. Both were so colorful, fresh, and flavorful. They definitely don't skimp on the fish here. The size of the rolls were pretty large and filling so one roll could easily leave you satisfied, but if you're a sushi lover like I am, I would recommend at least two. \n\nIf the food didn't impress me enough, the service was also exceptional during my visit, despite having a full dining room.

Two days back I stopped here for an oil change.  The employee wouldn't serve me because I declined to disclose my address.

And I still don't know why even though I called their customer service line and left a message. No call back.  And followed up with an email.  No response to that either. So.... if you like disclosing your address and personal info  to total strangers in connection with routine auto service, this may be a good fit for you.

I always assumed the logo was someone standing and throwing a boomerang.\n\nAnyway, this place has a lot to offer, despite being nestled in a strip mall next to a Wines and Spirits. If I hadn't dined there before, I might be hesitant about eating at a place that looks kinda sketchy from the outside, but all of the sushi is made fresh and the prices are very reasonable. Basic sushi rolls run $5 or $6, and \"fancy\" ones are $10 to $12 per roll. My partner and I usually split two basic rolls and one signature roll.\n\nUsually there aren't a lot of people here when we go, and service is fast and prompt. However, on Valentine's Day, it was packed. I should've known. Yes, it was crowded, but it took more than an hour for us to get our three rolls. No apologies. No other soups or finger foods to hold us over.\n\nThe thing that bothered me most was that it seemed like takeout orders were tripping up the servers rather than dining customers. Those orders seemed to take precedent. Staff would rush to prep things for orders and then sushi rolls and other orders would be sitting in a bag for several minutes until people came to pick them up. Two to three servers staffing the restaurant and handling takeout orders on a busy night just wasn't cutting it.\n\nI think this was an unusual scenario, however, if it wasn't for this experience, I probably would have left a five-star review.", "date": "2017-02-16 20:23:25"}

Came in for lunch with my dad, for the $16 sushi/sashimi lunch special.  Oh man, I dunno what people are smoking, but the sushi here is really, really bad.\n\nIt's yet another fake-sushi restaurant with individually-quick-frozen and haphazardly cut assortments of fish served with bottled ginger, fake wasabi, and bland, watery soy sauce.  You know the type of place; they're everywhere!  They all taste the same and they all have basically the same menus.  Whatever, for $16 I'm not expecting them to fly in live scallops and shuck them right before the meal or anything, but I do expect the meager ingredients to be prepared well.\n\nThe miso soup was OK.  Nothing special, pretty much the same pre-packaged stuff you get at any of these kinds of places.\n\nThe sushi was really bad.  I know the fish was frozen, but it did not taste even remotely fresh.  It had a weird, mealy texture, the kind that results from, say, ice crystals forming and then thawing after the fish is RE-FROZEN.  Probably why it tasted slightly off, too.\n\nThe nigiri was completely screwed up.  The rice didn't seem like sushi, or even short-grained rice.  It was basically Chinese takeout rice.  Thus, it didn't stick together and when I picked up the nigiri, the rice just fell apart.  There was also FAR too much vinegar in the rice.\n\nThe spicy tuna roll was unremarkable, other than it being a complete waste of tuna, since all you can taste is the spicy sauce.  Which is probably a good thing here, since the tuna tasted pretty bad.\n\nThe sashimi was pretty much inedible.  The texture and flavor were just way off.  Every piece tasted pretty much identical.  There were 4 different kinds of fish but if I was blind, you could have fooled me.\n\nI get this is Western PA and not the coast, but there are places that serve IQF fish competently and cheaply.  Even Giant Eagle sushi is better.", "date": "2013-05-25 07:14:19"}

I ordered red spicy level 1, my boyfriend ordered green spicy level 5 (the spiciest they make). If you don't like spicy food, don't order the curry. Level 1 is not American spicy level one, it's got a good level of spice which by my taste was perfect. The boyfriend always asks them to make it twice as spicy as the max because he's into ridiculously spicy food, and they even gave him a little cup of spice mix on the side so he can add extra if he wants. Today was the 3rd time we ordered, same as always, red and green curry. I love it more and more every time. Their curry is better than Nikki's thai kitchen in the North Hills (unless you don't like your curry spicy).  They're also way more affordable. However, this place is a hole in the wall, not easy to spot from the road, which means their customer base is not as big as they deserve and I fear that my favorite curry place could end up closing because of this. We went today, a Friday at 6pm and were the only ones there. We placed a pickup order and went to listen to music in the car and within 10 minutes our food was done and they brought it out to our car. The last time we went, we called right before closing and they stayed open late so we could place a pickup order. In conclusion, amazing curry, amazing prices, and amazing service. I can't wait to go back and try more items on the menu (in addition to my curry.)", "date": "2018-03-24 00:58:13"}

We have tried the breakfast corned beef hash (if you are a fan of the traditional hash theirs is a little different (light on the corned beef hash and has potatoes and peppers) and at first I wasn't sure if I liked it or not, but the more I had the more I liked it), hot dog, tater tots, mac n cheese, blue cheese burger and meatloaf and mashed potatoes (I do not like traditional meatloaf, but I loved theirs. It has a really great flavor and the mashed potatoes were fantastic).\n\nThe owner also walks around to make sure people are doing ok and like what they are eating asking for opinions on the food to make things better. With as busy as she is, I think that is commendable since she is one of the chefs. She is not afraid to get her hands dirty, which I like. A good owner is a person who is willing to roll up their sleeves and make sure things get done.\n\nThe point of this diatribe is for people to try Mac Diner, have PATIENCE (which some people on here obviously do not have) while they are trying things out in their pre-opening.

Even more disappointing considering I asked the server before ordering if it \"was good\".  She assured me it was.  I am the furthest thing from a gourmet on the face of this earth, but the brisket was so bad I wouldn't even serve it to my dog.  Firstly, in terms of thickness, think cheap bacon.  Cheap, fatty, gummy bacon.  Secondly, in terms of consistency, think cheap bacon (fatty, stringy, NOT tender in the least).  Simply BAD.  They should be ashamed of themselves for calling this stuff \"brisket\", let alone serving it to the public.  \n-when the server asked how the brisket was, I told her.  Because she appeared young and relatively inexperienced, I tried to be as polite as possible.  It became apparent that she told no one in the kitchen, though.  However, all is not lost.  Perhaps she will spare a future customer from ordering the brisket.  By the way, my wife ordered a \"brisket salad\", which is basically a salad with brisket on it, so no need to separately critique that.\n-speaking of salads, that's what I had as my side.  Very generic as salads go.  Not bad, not good.  No thousand island or sweet and sour dressing at Thirsty's, so I went with the blue cheese.  Nothing exceptional, no chunks of blue cheese.  Straight out of the bottle.\n\nAll in all, I'd say I learned my lesson.  You want good brisket, go to The Double Wide or Nashville.  Heck, I may even try the brisket at Arby's and update this review with a comparison.\nI AM a slow learner, though.  I WILL return to Thirsty's and try something else.\nMy prediction, though?  This place will not last.  Not unless they do something to improve the quality of their food.  There are too many other places in this general area with much better food.\n\nUPDATE:\nOk, so thought we would give it another shot.  We revisited Thirsty's last week.  We ordered something different this time:  me, a burger with onion rings; my wife, the gyro.\nI have to say, the burger was pretty awesome!  And my wife said her gyro was very good.  The onion rings were excellent, too.  They serve them with some kind of bloomin' onion dipping sauce, too (no boring ketchup for your rings here!).  I recently sampled the onion rings at J. Clark's; Thirsty's rings are much better.\nThe server was very nice; and efficient, too.\nAll in all, almost a total 180 from our first visit.\nSo, if you're visiting Thirsty's?  Pretty decent.  Just stay away from the brisket.", "date": "2013-10-03 22:11:44"}

I  know we were ALL thinking, \" this food better be worth the wait.\" It was not:(  Our group had the following- basic mac n cheese( bland was the consensus) wings( needed more sauce)   the dom( eh was the comment), mac n franks( \" I'll eat it since I ordered it\") a dish from the Oktoberfest menu( the comment here was OMG this looks awful..( pause) it tastes pretty bad too)  a salad with a  homemade dressing that was so slimy and chunky I could not even tell what  it was, and lastly potato pancakes that we had to ask for twice and then ask for the sour cream and apple sauce that came with them.\n\n The good: there is plenty of parking, the place is warm and appealing, the restrooms are clean and the prices are cheap.  However that does not make up for  lukewarm poor quality food served to  you  in to go containers over cork boards that takes almost 2 hours to receive. Also I should mention they are now BYOB, which is great. Not sure of the corkage fee as it  just started the evening we dined there.\n\nI  am so sad to write this review as I love local small places like this. The concept is also so unique. If they use better quality ingredients and improve the  service  it may have a shot.  I sure hope they do make it.", "date": "2012-10-17 16:01:07"}

Behind the counter there is....nothing.  No grill or griddle like you'd expect at a diner.  Nevertheless, I found the place clean and welcoming.  \n\nI was at the end of a long day so I decided to place my order to go.  Deciding what to get was the difficult part.  I was in the mood for some comfort food, so the pot roast with mashed potatoes appealed to me.  I also wanted to try some mac n cheese since that is their specialty.  And since I couldn't decide on just one, I went with two: Alpine and Cheeseburger.  \n\nMy Pot Roast was okay.  The potatoes were more smashed than mashed.  And while I was given a healthy side of gravy, there was no roll given with this meal.  Odd, especially when you consider that just next door is a Schwebel's Bakery outlet store.  The mac n cheese orders, both small, were $5 each.  The Alpine was a little stinky but very good with lots of Swiss cheese and ham.  And that small order was more than I could finish in one sitting.  The highlight of my choices was definitely the cheeseburger mac n cheese.  When I opened the container, it literally smelled like a Big Mac.  And even more impressive, that's exactly what it tasted like, too.  It was so amazing, I've been telling everyone who will listen.\n\nI plan on returning to MAC Diner at least until I have tried all the different kinds of mac n cheese.  And maybe I'll get there for breakfast one day.  Plus I saw tater tots on the menu and I am a sucker for tater tots.  I can't say much for the service as I did not dine in, but there were a few servers who were very attentive and had no problem sharing duties.\n\nTo make this place even more appealing, it is one of the places featured on WPXI's Just Pay Half Hot Card where you pay $25 for the card and it is worth $50 at local businesses.

We got appetizers and they were so-so (very small portions compared to other restaurants/bars in the area). After dinner, we noticed the owner was sitting at the bar so we asked if he could come over because we wanted to tell him that his website was wrong. He was very rude and said his website was right and that those have been the specials for 5 years- they just don't advertise them at the bar. That didn't make much sense to us but we went with it and then asked why we were charged more for our well drinks then... He didn't have an answer but he just got some cash from the register and gave us the money that was owed to us in cash. We all paid and left in agreement that we wouldn't be having our monthly dinners there anymore.\nThe worst part came though that night- 4 out of 5 of us became ill with vomiting, diarrhea, and severe stomach cramps.

The chicken parm had pepperoni on it and I personally judge a place based on their pepperoni. Barrel junction offers the small pepperoni that curls when cooked and collects all of the grease. What can I say, I like grease and this pepperoni is my favorite! The nachos and Bavarian pretzels are also delicious. \n\nI like that they offer a weekly draft and cocktail and that they have a decent beer selection. \n\nRoute 8 definitely needed a place like this!", "date": "2017-04-15 14:34:00"}

If you have a small appetite though you may want to split one of these babies because they do not skim on the filling. Next go around I'm so trying their veggie options. I have no idea what they do to the tortilla but it's magical. Would I try this particular taco again? Probably not. Maybe the slaw would've brought about a texture.

Prior to attending, I did some research on what food trucks would be there. I saw \"Mission Mahi\" listed and was curious to learn more, considering I had never heard of this truck before. I read an article on the owner's story and was really taken back by how amazing his story was and how awesome of an idea it was to bring awareness to recovery through a food truck. Genius. I knew we had to check it out when we came to the round up. \n\nNow I should point out, I don't eat fish. At all. I do like the occasional shrimp or even crab sometimes, but no fish. I was hesitant on ordering something for myself, but my parents on the other hand, were not- they love fish. My dad ordered the \"tex mex\" fish taco and my mom ordered \"the yinzer\". My dad also ordered some fries as well. We were surprised with how quick the food was ready, and how huge the portions were. My dad LOVED his taco. He couldn't stop saying how fresh it was and how tasty it was. I tried some fries and they were super good. My mom also loved her taco & couldn't even finish it because it was THAT big. The service was great- my dad chatted with the owner for a bit and really enjoyed talking to him. \n\nI am really looking forward to seeing this food truck out & about this summer and even if I am not adventurous enough to order a fish taco, I would definitely check out their other menu items and get some more of their delicious fries. This truck's mission is amazing and I highly recommend looking up their story!", "date": "2016-02-05 17:03:45"}

Walked out of the room, came back, asked me if I knew which tires I wanted. I did, I told him, he checked that they were in stock, which they were. We spent several minutes looking up prices on my phone, and he tried selling me several things I didn't want. I get that, it's his job. I told them what I wanted, he showed me the waiting room and I sat there for over an hour and a half waiting. Finally came back and said I needed new brake pads did I want them to install?

I could not return until the day after, to which the same man asked me for my card number. I told him the charge was already taken. He said it was for paperwork only, and assured me they would not charge it again- and against all my better judgment I gave it to them.

You're high up in the trees but I was focused on watching my man or looking at what I needed to do on the nice stage to worry about the height. Plus I really trusted the equipment so falling wasn't a concern. The ziplines and tarzen swings are very fun although my landings in the mulch were less than graceful. You will definitely sweat so bring a change of clothes if you have somewhere to go after. Also, if you think you'll land like me be prepared to get mulch everywhere.

I'm really afraid of heights, but it's still a lot of fun. The very first part is actually the hardest. Climbing the highest rope ladder and jumping into a tarzan swing right away is not easy, but after that things settle down a little bit. It's hard though, both mentally and physically. You're on your own, so you need to really pay attention to the safety stuff at the beginning because you are responsible for your own safety. The face that you're on your own is part of what makes it good though. You don't need to wait around for an instructor and a whole group. It's a little crowded at the beginning, but after that people kind of spread out a bit.\n\nThis is a great bonding experience. It's hard, but never boring.

I cannot tell you how underwhelmed we were by everything. Ordered the tuna - the server asked what temp we would like it cooked. We said medium. Well clearly it was not an option. Not an unusual dish, seared tuna loin that was clearly intended to be served by rare, which it was. Why ask if it only comes one way? The tuna was clearly of high quality, but there was no attempt to season it - it was just warmed on the outside and sesame seeds were slapped on the sides. It was painfully under seasoned and uninspired. The beet salad, a dish that could, with very little effort be creative and delicious... It was not. A pile of arugula, sliced beets, a thumbprint of ch\u00e8vre and a dressing that was without any impact on the dish as a whole. The lobster pasta with cream sauce tasted as if no thought or creativity was ever considered. Almost every dish on the menu had cream or cheese. Are we in Wisconsin? I wonder if the \"chef\", and I use the term loosely, has a dairy addiction and might consider a 12 step program. The door in the front lets the cold winter air in, making the entire mediocre experience downright unpleasant. The service was slow, but no more than OK. Even  after asking our waiter to do something about the door twice, we were told that sometimes the one door gets locked, but on this particular day it was a fire code infraction. Odd on how sometimes the door can be locked and some days it can't - laws are funny that way, I guess. After two comments about the door, a good server would probably ask if we would like to move, mid-meal as a number of tables were vacated during our meal, but that didn't happen. Perhaps thee server would have the manager come speak to us about our discomfort, but that didn't happen either. I did not notice anyone in the restaurant, again I use the term loosely, who even appeared to be a manager. We will not be back and I suggest that you eat at the DMV instead. At least there the service and food are probably better. Don't waste your time, unless you like painfully sweet martinis, again, I use that term loosely too.

I did an online search for places that specialize in cleaning wedding dresses and Owl Cleaners popped up.  I called around to a few other places and overall Owl's was the most helpful, nice and had the best rates  A few weeks later I dropped my wedding dress off at the Allison Park location and a few days later it was sent to their Warrendale location to be cleaned.  Sandy, who does all of the wedding dress cleanings at the Warrendale location, had the dress spot cleaned and pressed in a few days-they say it can take up to 3-4 weeks but mine was done quickly. I was a little disappointed that they did not call me when it was done and I had to call them but it was done so quickly it really did not matter. The price was very affordable and they did a nice job.  Now here comes the issue.  The dress was supposed to be transported back to the Allison Park store where I drooped it off at.  I called the day before we were going to pick it up and they did not have it.  I called the Warrendale store and they said they did not have it either and did not know where my dress was.  My wedding was only 3 weeks away and as you can imagine I was extremely upset.  After about an hour the store called and said they found my dress-it had never been put on the truck to be delivered back to the Allison Park store and they offered to deliver the dress to my home. I appreciated their quick response and solid customer service in dealing with this issue.

I looked up my tire size on the NTB website and called to make an appointment.  They quoted me \"out the door\" for four tires at $340 and it would be done in an hour.  So I go and they quickly figure out that the wrong size was entered into the computer, so the price I was quoted was wrong and instead it would be $420.  If I had anywhere else to go I would have.  Not to mention they had to go to Monroeville to get the tires.  They told me they would have the tires in an hour.  They didn't get done with my car until 3 hours after I walked through the door.  So I end up spending an extra $80 and 2 hours.  They do get one star because at least my tires didn't fall off on the way home.  I am completely disgusted with the experience and will never return.  Interestingly enough, as I was sitting in the waiting room, another customer was charged more that the \"out the door\" price.  He argued and they were able to get his price down to the quoted price.\n\n*Update* I contacted the corporate office of NTB to share my experience with them.  They were very apologetic and said that proper procedure hadn't been followed on their end.  They offered me a gift certificate to give them a second chance, and I just may take them up on it, although it will be at a different NTB location.  But kudos to NTB for trying to do the right thing.\n\n***further update***- gift certificate never came, which in all honesty is fine because now have no reason to ever return there", "date": "2017-05-20 17:33:57"}

I was there last night and they've made a few changes, but the menu and space is basically the same.  They are building another private dining room which will hold up to 34 which is good for business functions they also have another smaller private room which holds about a dozen.  The space itself is pretty warm.  It finds the balance between \"fine\" dining and neighborhood bar pretty well.  They have a few booths a relatively large dining room and a big bar with a couple plasmas and a jukebox.  The menu is pretty much the same as it has been for years, however they've added a \"tapas\" menu.  It's not really tapas more like small appetizers, but a nice addition.  We started with a nice cheese platter with room temperature asiago and a nice balsamic.  There were also a nice selection of olives and a good salami and prosciutto.  The last few times I tried a charcuterie plate the items were ice cold, it's nice to see that these folks now how to serve this appetizer.  We then tried a scallop/shrimp appetizer, which was okay.  The shrimp was a bit charred and the scallop was cooked well, but relatively flavorless.  The soba noodle salad was just okay, this dish was probably my least favorite.  We also tried a delicious duck confit ravioli which was my favorite of the night.   A really nice dish on  a fall night.  The duck filling was delicious and the ravioli was cooked al dente'.  Finally, Lisa and I shared a filet entree.  The filet was cooked perfectly and the risotti was very nice.  Too often when I order risotti it's \"mushy\", however this was a nice compliment to the filet.  Kim is a good bartender and I've been friends with him for years.  He makes a really strong martini, so be careful.  The wine selection leaves a bit too be desired.   I suggest you stick to the martini list, you won't be disappointed.  This is a nice little spot hidden away in an unassuming place.", "date": "2008-11-07 15:20:36"}

I guess I didn't realize that before I went and I'm not sure I would have still gone if I had a better understanding.  But I've been saying for months I wanted to check it out so I went solo and blindly but up for a challenge, taking advantage or their end of summer discount by booking online.\n\nStaff is friendly and helpful.  The location near the North Park boathouse means parking shouldn't be a problem.  You check in and sign a waiver. \n They make sure you are secure in your harness and take you through several safety rules before setting you loose.  They also give you opportunity to leave with a full refund if it's not quite what you expected after the safety talk and training which is nice.  But I still wanted to go in.\n\nTreetop adventures is a much better way to describe Go Ape.  I found the course fun but more physically challenging than if it were just ziplines.  Yes, there are ziplines.  But you have to go through a series of various obstacle courses to get to each zipline.  I was afraid I'd be paralyzed by my slight fear of heights.  That was not a concern at all once I got up into the trees.  I found myself so focused on what was right in front of me and making it to the next platform that I never really looked straight down.  Even at the ziplines we were instructed to just sit down into the harness and let our feet go.  This was the best way to feel more at ease with the zipline reward at the end of each course (vs making it seem like I was free falling to the ground).  I was not very graceful with my landings but I had a great time nonetheless.\n\nThe courses are self-paced with instructors nearby on the ground only if needed and to make sure everyone is following safety precautions.  Depending on the size of the group at your scheduled time, the full course will take 2-3 hours.  I was sore for days after this but I'd definitely do it again.

I went with my cousins (we're between 18 and 21), and all of us had a great experience. The park it was in was beautiful - I highly suggest either arriving early or planning on staying later to do some walking around. On the way, we got a little bit lost and ended up arriving late (about 10 minutes). We called ahead and they said the earliest they could get us in was 2.5 hours later. When we actually got there, though, they were able to still get us in with the group!!\n\nThe training is very thorough. You start on the ground to learn how to connect all of your things up, then you go to a small platform (less than 10 feet off the ground) to practice again and get the feel for the zipline. During the first set of crossings, the instructor is on the ground to answer any questions (most of which seemed to be \"Is this right? Am I hooked up right?\"). After that, you're on your own! (Although there are instructors wandering around the park).\n\nWhile it is a physical activity, you don't have to be in excellent shape to get through the course. My sister, who is a collegiate athlete, did have an easier time than me, but there was never a time that I thought \"I can't do this\". The most physically demanding part is probably the Tarzan Swing, where you fly into a net and have to climb the net up to the platform. While we were there, one of the younger kids in front of us was having trouble, and the instructor was able to use a pulley to help him climb up. In our group, there were also people who didn't seem like they were in great shape, but they still had a good time! And since the course isn't one long thing, but rather 5 sets, if you do get tired you can also sit one out and watch the rest of the group.\n\nYou can also go at your own pace. If you're worried that you're holding the people behind you back, you can always offer to let them pass you.\n\nThe staff was really friendly and helpful, and they all seemed to be very knowledgeable about what they're doing. Something I thought was awesome was that while we were doing training, they said that if you didn't think you'd be able to do the course, or that you wouldn't be able to be responsible for a child you were with, you could get a refund. I'd assume that once you actually started the course ou wouldn't get any refund, but I was surprised that if you were too scared before you started, you'd still get your money back.\n\nThings to be aware of when you're visiting:\n-The only bathrooms I saw were porta-potties.\n-There's nowhere that sells food, but by the end of the course you'll probably be hungry. There are some picnic tables right by the entrance to the course, so I highly suggest packing a lunch and enjoying the park!\n-If you have really sensitive hands, bring gloves. I started to get a little rope burn.\n\nMy cousins and I had a fantastic time, and as I'll be living in Pittsburgh next year, I'm hoping to return!!", "date": "2014-08-09 23:34:22"}

It's more physical than zip lining I have done in the past--a good portion of your time will be spent hoisting yourself up rope ladders and across various crossing obstacles, so be prepared for that.  There are also five ziplines and two tarzan swings.  At the one place I had ziplined before, the instructor went with the group the whole time, but at Go Ape!, they give you a thorough class and then release you to go at your own pace.  This made me VERY NERVOUS at first, but it ended up being even more fun. The instructors watch from the ground and give you a whistle to use if you need help--which we didn't.

Those posts are surely posted by someone in the company itself.  This is the worst place I've dealt with in many years.

They gave me detailed information on what to ask for when I call Alpine.  They could not give an actual price but told me what wholesale (before shipping) would be, but said its up to the store as to what price they quote.  So I called Alpine and explained what I needed and what exactly to ask for when they called the wholesaler.  They said they would call me back later that day or the next day.  But I never heard back.  I waited 2 weeks and then called back myself.  I called and spoke to several different people but they left messages for the person I first spoke to who what the ordering agent for the business.  She never called.  Finally after over a month, one of my calls caught her there and she said she had my information (so why didn't she ever try calling me?).  The price she gave me was a range rather than an actual price and when she started explaining why she couldn't quote a price, I realized she wasn't talking about the same thing I was calling about.  I reminded her about my original conversation with her and asked if she still had it written down, the exact name of the coping I needed.  She said she will have to call the wholesaler again and get the info and call me back.  I said I cannot wait another month, how long will it take to hear back.  She said she will call tomorrow.  And that was over a week ago.  Never heard back and I know I won't. \n\nSo I called the wholesaler (manufacturer) myself again and explained that I cannot get Alpine to work with me and asked if they called back recently.  They told me that no one EVER called them about any of this except me.  So she outright lied to me with the made up price range.  The manufacturer then gave me another company they deal with in the Pittsburgh area, and I called them yesterday and gave them the same information I gave Alpine originally.  To my delight, the guy called me back literally 2 hours later with the price and all details on the options (section lengths available).  I placed the order and I was done 2 hours after my first call with them.  I really want to say the name of this company, but if I did, I know someone reading this would think this is a fake comment just to plug Alpine's competition, and I don't want to take a chance of someone thinking this isn't real.  \n\nAlso, if a company doesn't want to bother with something, why wouldn't they just be honest about it?  Oh and this wasn't some $20 item that wasn't worth someone's time.  The total charge was over $1800.  I think that's worth at least a call back.  DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME WITH ALPINE.

We ended up deciding to buy and started talking about our trade. \n\nThe business owner made the sales person check the entire trade in vehicle (a 2008 Audi Q7) with a paint meter. All four corners (fenders) were one thickness and everywhere else was another. They insisted that all of the fenders were repainted (on all 4 corners never the less) even though it had never been in an accident. They ultimately left it at \"well the car must have been damaged when it was transported and the dealer you bought it from repainted it\". Even then they had no qualms about buying it, it just seemed like a ploy to low-ball their trade offer. \n\nWhen we first arrived the sales person told us a price of $31K. When we got to the paperwork it became $32K. We were certain he'd said $31K, I pulled up their website on my Smartphone but it said $32K. I had also seen the ad on Autotrader before we arrived but now it was gone! We battled over this and they finally agreed to honor the $31K price. THIS PRICE GIMMICK WAS FAR WORSE THAN WE SUSPECTED, PLEASE KEEP READING. \n\nWe finalized the deal after several hours of being at the lot, drove about 5-6 miles and the car literally died and would not start back up.

I was very upset between the hassle with the trade, the bait and switch with the price, and now the fact we were now broke down on the side of the road in pouring rain. When he arrived he threaten to \"knock me the f*** out\" because I swore at him on the phone which he claimed his young daughter heard. Unless his daughter has extraordinary hearing I doubt she could hear the details of that call. The other 2 people with me deescalated the situation with the business owner and we all agreed to just cancel out the deal completely. \n\nThe absolute topper was once we got back home I opened my laptop up and the ads were still there from earlier. The car was actually listed for $30K and these shadies went on and changed their website once they had interested buyers to reflect a $2K higher price. They also removed their Autotrader ad completely but again I still had the page from earlier showing a $30K price. \n\nAll I can say to others if this is the experience we got from this place, I can't imagine what else goes on here. I guarantee this was not the first time these 2 jokers went on their website and ads to change the price. The salesperson raised the price $1K to $31K when we first arrived and we didn't notice. It took the second $1K price increase to $32K before we noticed and they had still \"got\" us for $1K. It's easy to be a victim when your dealing with pro-scammers.", "date": "2013-10-04 17:36:41"}

College Hunks made this move a nightmare.  My last two moves were done by Two Men and Truck who where phenomenal each time.  For this move I could not get Two Men or any of the other high quality movers for the date I needed.  I called College Hunks and the price was low and the customer service was great (I should have known something was up they were the only company with openings).  They connected me to the local company that supports the Pittsburgh area and what the owner Laura lacked in customer service she made up for with the price.\n\nWhen the truck pulled up I was immediately concerned with the size and if the truck could hold all of our belongings.  When the movers did the walk through they knew right away that the truck was not big enough.  I tried calling Laura who didn't answer so I called the main office and that good customer service turned on me and their option was to make me pay for two trips.  I refused to go for the bait and switch.  The movers were upset that they were not told about the stairs which I made certain to share during the set up.  As stated I am not new to moving.  \n\nThe move was horrible the movers forgot one of my TVs which I had to hurry and take to my home before the cable company arrived.  They never hauled out a piece of furniture in the basement they agreed to remove and they left 40 boxes that could not fit on the truck.  I told the movers I am only paying for 4 hours which they felt was fair because they felt screwed over as well.\n\nI spent the following weekend moving the 40 boxes from my previous residence to my new home using multiple cars and trips.  Do not use this company you get what you pay for and the company in no way tried to reconcile they just blamed me for the mistake.  That is fine I eventually moved all our stuff in. I now tell anyone who ask me about movers or moving to  never use these movers stick with Two Men and a Truck or another company with a stellar reputation.", "date": "2018-08-05 19:25:41"}

Like with most pets, trips to the vet are always stressful. Normally, our cats just aren't big fans of going (though they tolerate it, with puffy tails and lots of shedding) and this year, I was going to have to take the two cats PLUS an infant with me. I don't have enough arms for all of that, so we called Vet to Pet to try their services out.\n\nWhen the vet and tech arrived, they brought in their tools and set up shop in the living room, which was totally fine. I was expecting them to sit on the floor and get to know the cats for a couple of minutes, maybe getting in some pets and calming \"conversations\"  before starting the exams, as most animals prefer to get to know new people prior to being touched and handled. The two vets we've gone to in the past have always done that...they talk to the cats and pet them for a bit before getting anything started. That didn't really happen. The tech did sit on the floor, but there wasn't much interaction between her and the cats outside of the cats sniffing all of her things. I was immediately asked for payment. Between the time I went to get our credit card and the time I came back, our laid back cat was hissing, growling, and clawing like I've never seen. We've had him for almost 10 years and he's never, ever reacted that way to us or anyone else he's been around, including his normal vet. They ended up putting a muzzle on him, which was pretty horrifying. I should have ended the appointment there, but by that point, I had a crying baby on my hip who was upset by the whole scene. They were finally able to give him his shots and I think they maybe listened to his heart, but he had no other examination because he just didn't want to be touched or handled by these strangers he had no chance to get to know. We still paid the full amount for his examination. When they were done with him, he got loose before they could get the muzzle off and ran into several things, hissing and shaking, because he was so upset by the whole situation. Totally unacceptable.\n\nOur second cat was a little easier for them; she allowed them to examine her. Again, the muzzle came out for the shots. The way they handled her, too, was way more aggressive than I've ever seen her be handled before and I think that was a huge part of the problem. Our usual vet has me hold her legs, the vet tech holds her front paws and she does nothing more than growl.\n\nOverall, the whole scene was very chaotic and atypical of our cats. The older male is usually very laid back, the younger female is kind of crazy but in a very playful way. Neither have ever had to be muzzled or held aggressively in order to be examined or given their shots. Maybe they just weren't into the whole vet in their home idea, but the whole visit just didn't feel right for anyone involved.\n\nBoth the vet and the tech were nice enough. I didn't feel like the vet was really hands on or that interested in our cats, but maybe that was just because it was a Friday afternoon, or she'd had a bad day. Who knows? I can't imagine that we'd do this again; from here on out we'll stick with their usual vet.", "date": "2015-07-17 22:34:36"}

Had not been here  for perhaps 3 years. Last left off where my opinion was, \"hmm overpriced wine but they have some nice appetizers and flatbread\" . Let's give it a shot for a couple o glasses and their great charcuterie plate.\n\nWell, the wine list got pricier, yet the quality no better, nothing on the list less than 12 dollars and some at $20. \n\nThe charcuterie plate, comes in for 2 or for 4 people size options. The waitress asked the two of us if we wanted the 2 or four people option. Strange we thought, do we look like we are big eaters or  very hungry. When it arrived I see why she asked, it was tiny  consisting of a few pieces of what looked like your local super markets sandwich meat some small pieces of asparagus hearts. All of this on a skinny rectangular plate not the large plater of times past.  The collective opinion on seeing and sampling was one of \"Seriously!\" For $15 this was an affront. \n\nThe flatbread instead of the fresh baked warm stuff of the past was somewhat stale very overly salted clearly yesterdays flatbread. Not even warmed up to fake fresh.\n\nWe'd planned on getting the stuffed banana peppers as they were a saving grace of the past, but this slap in the  face app combined with the wine list consisting of nary a bottle under $46 on the red side, once again prompted views of \"What are they thinking\".  We then looked at one another and said \" What's plan B\" and departed for what turned out to be a good experience in another North Hills place.\n\nAdditionally  the wine was served at a \"flabby temperature\" Not that I'd mention for a run of the mill place, since all but fin dining places typically do not serve at the right term it but if you are going to have $20 by the glass wines and greater than $100 on the menu bottles you should perhaps understand the concept of serving at the correct temperature.", "date": "2014-10-28 03:35:52"}

My apartment has no elevator and a couple flights of stairs and the couches I had them lift to take away, it was extremely hard work for anyone to do and very heavy to lift.

Those posts are surely posted by someone in the company itself.  This is the worst place I've dealt with in many years.  I really don't have the time to figure out how to make this comment but I'm so upset with them that I am taking the time to do this.  \n\nI need something for my in ground pool and tracked down the manufacturer and they could not sell direct to me but gave me Alpine phone number as the retailer they work with that was closest to me.  They gave me detailed information on what to ask for when I call Alpine.  They could not give an actual price but told me what wholesale (before shipping) would be, but said its up to the store as to what price they quote.  So I called Alpine and explained what I needed and what exactly to ask for when they called the wholesaler.  They said they would call me back later that day or the next day.  But I never heard back.  I waited 2 weeks and then called back myself.  I called and spoke to several different people but they left messages for the person I first spoke to who what the ordering agent for the business.  She never called.  Finally after over a month, one of my calls caught her there and she said she had my information (so why didn't she ever try calling me?).  The price she gave me was a range rather than an actual price and when she started explaining why she couldn't quote a price, I realized she wasn't talking about the same thing I was calling about.  I reminded her about my original conversation with her and asked if she still had it written down, the exact name of the coping I needed.  She said she will have to call the wholesaler again and get the info and call me back.  I said I cannot wait another month, how long will it take to hear back.  She said she will call tomorrow.  And that was over a week ago.  Never heard back and I know I won't. \n\nSo I called the wholesaler (manufacturer) myself again and explained that I cannot get Alpine to work with me and asked if they called back recently.  They told me that no one EVER called them about any of this except me.  So she outright lied to me with the made up price range.  The manufacturer then gave me another company they deal with in the Pittsburgh area, and I called them yesterday and gave them the same information I gave Alpine originally.  To my delight, the guy called me back literally 2 hours later with the price and all details on the options (section lengths available).  I placed the order and I was done 2 hours after my first call with them.  I really want to say the name of this company, but if I did, I know someone reading this would think this is a fake comment just to plug Alpine's competition, and I don't want to take a chance of someone thinking this isn't real.  \n\nAlso, if a company doesn't want to bother with something, why wouldn't they just be honest about it?  Oh and this wasn't some $20 item that wasn't worth someone's time.  The total charge was over $1800.  I think that's worth at least a call back.  DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME WITH ALPINE.  That's a slogan I hope stays with anyone reading this.  They are incompetent and inconsiderate.", "date": "2017-03-21 01:50:45"}

I've lived here over 4 years and even though I knew it existed, I had never been motivated to try it.

The view of the falling snow made for a beautiful backdrop but some dangerous roads later at night.\n\nThe table started with the antipasta platter and the flatbread with goat cheese, mushrooms, spinach and tomatoes.  The flatbread was a must have if you go there and to be honest, the best part of my meal.  It had such strong, great flavors.  The antipasta platter was good too.  For dinner, I ordered an item off the weekend special menu:  potato and Dijon crusted tilapia with a red pepper sauce and asparagus for $24.  The meal also came with soup or salad, and I opted for the spicy, black bean soup.  The soup was good but it was very thick so if you don't love black beans it was not something you should try.  The asparagus was grilled perfectly and tasted delicious.  The tilapia was ok and was the least favorite party of my meal.  It was cooked well but I couldn't taste any Dijon and despite my love of potatoes, there was something that I can't put my finger on that I didn't like about the crusting.  Maybe the crust was too thick and just wasn't crunchy enough but I'm really not sure what it was?\n\nWe had two servers for our table (group of about 15 people in our party) and they were great.  They kept the glasses refilled and were very attentive throughout the night.  My biggest gripe is that the place is a little on the pricey side.

The food here is so good. Like, we're talking \"this would be a competitor for my last meal\" good. It's admittedly also somewhere you could easily spend a ton of money on dinner - if your group is big enough, you'd drop a couple hundred dollars here without any difficulty. But it's absolutely worth it for a special night out.\n\nSo far I've been here twice, once for a sampler event and once for a full meal. The sampler was just so wonderful that I had to come back and eat more. I ended up visiting with my family to celebrate my upcoming birthday. And for the most part, the full meal did not disappoint.\n\nFirstly, this place has one of the best foreign wine menus you'll find in the area. I splurged and had a couple glasses of wine during my meal here specifically because you can't easily find Argentinian wine anywhere else within the greater Pittsburgh area. So right off the bat, this place started off with a big thumbs up.\n\nAnd as I said earlier, the food is just excellent. During my meal here my family and I shared a fig, beet, and cheese flatbread that was just perfect - it had a little touch of dressing, the right amount of crunch and an absolutely delicious blend of flavors that made for a not-too-sweet-not-too-bitter appetizer. No complaints about the salad, which was green and leafy and not drenched in dressing - just how I like my salads. For my main course I chose the lobster ravioli, which came with a huuuge tray of sauces that I admittedly barely touched - the ravioli really didn't need that much extra flavoring, as it was just flavorful all on on its own. But the sauces I did try were quite interesting and good as well. I also sampled the duck and braised short-rib when my family members traded bites of our food, and oh man - yum! That duck in particular was a little bite of heaven. I would absolutely order that during a return visit.\n\nReally, the only issue we had at all during our meal was the delay it took for our main meals to arrive. Our dinner reservation was for 6:30pm, and for about an hour things progressed at a normal pace. Unfortunately, something happened in the kitchen that resulted in our table seeing absolutely no food between 7:30 and 8:00. Granted, we weren't starving thanks to the appetizers and salads that had arrived throughout the previous hour, and it was clear that what was happening had nothing to do with our attentive and apologetic waitress, but the amount of time we were delayed by was still pretty significant. We were at least comped dessert as an apology (chocolate cherry cake - a rich and decedent dessert that added an amazing touch to an overall excellent meal) and it didn't spoil the evening at all, but it was still a good thing that we didn't have any timely plans for after our dinner.\n\nDelays or no delays, I will continue to love the Tuscan Inn. I also probably won't be here for at least another year. Or two. Because good food or not, those prices just aren't in my normal budget. But I guess those prices and the amazing quality of the food here are exactly what make Tuscan Inn such a great special occasion dining spot.", "date": "2015-02-09 21:42:02"}

I can only comment on our experience - if you hire them, best of luck.\n  After their initial half-hour delay, the crew worked efficiently when watched like a hawk and supervised to prevent Facebook sessions. Terrific. The crew used any available excuse to not pack all the finished boxes waiting for them (weirdly insisting on packing a single inaccessible mattress early in a *gigantic* 26' box truck), and had to be urged to continue working. Fantastic.\n  We were packing boxes on moving day, working closed off in the kitchen and study, which did not impair her crew from loading the bedroom, living room, and dining room, where many pre-packed boxes were waiting. Many of our pre-packed boxes were still waiting - untouched - when ***her movers walked off the job AFTER 4 HOURS***, and we had to carry them into our moving truck in the dark to keep on schedule with our other movers.\n  We didn't ask her crew to pack any empty boxes. They appeared to have an allergy to protecting furniture with blankets, straps, and plastic wrap or resting finished wood without tearing it up on concrete. Needless to say, we didn't trust them with dishes.\n\nBOTTOM LINE: These \"movers\" estimated the job would take 4 hours by phone, and then - with many boxes and pieces of furniture remaining - felt entitled to walk off the job after 4 hours.

I would never hire this company again, and I will be sure to warn my colleagues and friends living in Pittsburgh. The two gentlemen who initially showed up to move my household goods into a rented truck seemed unprepared and unfamiliar with household moving. After about a half hour of complaining about the scale of the job and discussing with their boss (two bedroom apartment, 22 foot truck, second floor apartment, flat property-all of which were described in detail when the movers are booked), the first item (a green couch) was finally loaded onto the truck. Despite multiple episodes of direction and repeated promises, the movers refused to use ratchet tiedown straps I provided to secure goods in the truck, rags or moving blankets to protect items in the truck, or large format plastic wrap to secure drawers and protect furniture. The movers seemed unfamiliar with basic moving equipment, were unable to make use of furniture dollies and hand trucks I provided. The movers were inconsiderate with my furniture, placing finished wooden surfaces onto rough concrete unnecessarily, and stacked heavy boxes on light boxes in the moving truck for their own convenience, which I had to personally fix. Two of the movers from the company briefly showed up to assist the original two movers, however they left without notice, with much of the work remaining. The original two movers told me they had 'other work,' could not complete moving my household goods into the truck with approximately a third of the moving work undone, and walked off the job on moving day - which will cost me hundreds of dollars to remedy and at least a week delay. I have worked with many moving companies, but have never experienced this degree of frankly shocking unprofessionalism. Offering your services for hire as a moving company is false advertising in my opinion. Based on their abysmal performance, I wouldn't trust them to haul junk.

I have moved 6 times in the last 10 years, so I am writing this review with a bit of experience. Despite alerting the scheduler to the size of my move (2-bedroom apartment on the 2nd floor), she only sent two people. They were overwhelmed by the size of the job and said their boss hadn't told them how big it was. \n\nThey milled about for a while deciding how to tackle the job, warned me that it might take longer than what was quoted, and asked if that was okay. (What choice do you have when it is moving day?!) They ended up calling the company to see if they could get more help. At this point, a half hour has passed and nothing has been moved, but I am paying for them to do all this. \n\nThey finally start loading the truck, but seem unfamiliar with how to pack a moving truck, and don't take much care with things. They place boxes labeled 'books - heavy' on top of boxes labeled 'fragile.' They don't seem to know what to do with tie-down straps or blankets, and they placed a wooded coffee table on a gravel driveway on its top, marring the surface. \n\nBut I have got to get out of town - lease is ending, movers are waiting on me in another city - so I direct as best I can, and hope for the best. After an hour and a half, the truck is only 10% full because they are moving so slowly. Reinforcements show up - 2 more people. Great! Except one of these additional workers keeps walking into a room, looking at the boxes and then just walking out without taking anything. So - not very useful. But I am still paying by the hour for this.\n\nSo, 4 and a half hours after they first arrived, the truck is only 1/2 packed and they say they are leaving because they have another job. What?!?!?! I have never had movers walk off a job. I have had moves take longer than expected due to weather, but I have never had movers just leave. Why is the next client more important? They couldn't answer that. Over and over, they blamed the scheduler and just keep saying - sorry. But sorry isn't getting my stuff put into the moving truck. I now have a bill of several hundred more than I was quoted, a poorly-packed truck with only 1/2 my stuff, and no movers. \n\nI felt kinda bad for the guys. I mean - they didn't move very fast, but it is also obvious they didn't get any training on how to pack a truck, and their boss didn't send the right number of people from the get-go. I was never contacted by the boss despite claims by the movers that she would be in touch with me.\n\nIn the end, this terrible moving company cost me over a thousand dollars extra in hotel bills, truck fees, additional movers, etc. I couldn't leave on time and I had to return with another truck to get the rest of the stuff. I believe I deserve a refund  of at least some of my payment for their poor work, but I can't reach the owner, so I doubt I will ever get it. \n\nHopefully, by writing this review, I will spare someone else the terrible experience I had. They took my money and did not deliver. Do not hire these people for moving.", "date": "2017-07-26 20:03:21"}

PC at Foreign Traffic explained the work that needed to be done and the prices for each part+labor. Their estimate beat my dealer's. So rather than junk my baby, I went with the repairs. They were done in a couple days and meanwhile, I was given a nice A6 loaner to drive. I also asked them to do my annual state inspections and while that resulted in additional needed repairs, I can vouch that the dealer would have charged way more.\n\nPC was very straightforward and honest with me about the things I'd need to do in order to extend the life of the car for (hopefully) years to come. \n\nIn short, my baby's got a new lease on life. I had never really thought I'd take her past 120k but now I'm hoping for even more than that.
